Took Spooky into the vet today (now that his course of antibiotics is completed), and he is a healthy little kitty.  Both kitties have now had their vaccinations: Merry has had the full set of rabies and FVRCP shots, and Spooky had his first dose of the FVRCP today.  I'll have to take him back in another month for the FVRCP booster, and then a month or two after that for rabies.  Both kitties also have negative blood tests (kitty HIV and leukemia), so they both have clean bills of health. :)

Unfortunately, this now means the next thing on the to-do list for Merry is to get a little snip-snip, but she'll be a lot happier, and so will we.
