Looks like Tiger's new Dashboard could use some refinement when it comes to [security](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/07/the-problem-with-widgets/).  Looks like it's pretty trivial to make a user auto-download a widget when they visit a webpage in Safari, it'll then auto-install if they're using the default Safari settings, and then they'll be running a potentially very obnoxious (and possibly even malicious) widget that's impossible for average Joe user to remove.  With any luck they'll refine this a bit in 10.4.1 (or possibly 10.4.2 since 10.4.1 has already been [seeded to developers](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/06/10-4-1-seeded-to-developers/)).
