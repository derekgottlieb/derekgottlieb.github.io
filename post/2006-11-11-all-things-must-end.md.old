I've been expecting to hear this for a while, but it's still a bummer to find out that [The Reputation](http://www.reputationmusic.com) have officially broken up.  In Elizabeth's words:


> As I'm guessing many of you have already figured out, the band is over.

Sean quit. Rest of us just gave up, I guess. I don't currently have plans to do any more music or play any more shows. Breaks my fucking heart.


All I can say is thanks for the music, and I hope it's not the last bit of music that comes from everyone in the group.

Wonder if any of the new tracks they were working on will ever see the light of day...
