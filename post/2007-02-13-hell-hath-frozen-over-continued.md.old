> All Wednesday (Feb. 14) classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have been cancelled.

Continuing high winds and snow have made it impossible to keep streets and sidewalks clear and safe.

Only personnel providing critical services should continue to report for each work shift until further notice. Employees uncertain about their status should direct any questions to their supervisors.

Classes at the U. of I. Child Development Lab also are cancelled for Wednesday.

Ok.  So it was unusual enough that they cancelled classes today.  But now they've pre-emptively canceled class tomorrow too.  Granted, it didn't stop snowing all day (kept looking outside to see if I should start shoveling the driveway/sidewalk or keep waiting), and the winds are pretty fierce.  But two days in a row???  Amazing!
