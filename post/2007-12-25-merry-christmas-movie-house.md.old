It's that time of year.  Time to watch favorites like "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron Howard) and "A Christmas Story" (they looked at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears!).  Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me before I had a chance to notice.  Fortunately I was able to get the little bit of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn't nearly as bad as I had feared.  The week or so after Thanksgiving was much worse, although I'll admit I didn't bother with any insanity like Target or Walmart which can be a little crazy all the time.  I was disappointed if not surprised to see that CompUSA has yet to be really marking anything down by enough to make it interesting.  5-10% off does not a chain-wide store-closing make.  Perhaps after the holidays they'll get more desperate.

Anyway, the real reason I started this post is to write about a couple of entertaining tidbits I heard kids say in church this year.  The first dates back to Westminster in CU when Pastor Laura was asking the kids about communion, what's the significance, what do we do, etc.  One rather astute child stated quite plainly that "we drink blood."  I suppose that about sums it up.  Wasn't sure whether her grandma was going to laugh or cry after that one.  Second one happened a couple of weeks ago here at Grace in AL.  Some of the youth from the church were leading children's time and trying to contrast Jesus with the images the little kids associate with other kings.  Instead of jewels you have the crown of thorns, etc.  When they asked what kings ride, the kids piped up with a horse.  But when they asked what Jesus rode, the kids were a little stumped.  Finally one of the more vocal youngsters announced that "Jesus rides a monkey".  He was quite adamant that he has seen Jesus ride a monkey.

Not sure where else to go after that one, but I hope this finds everyone in good spirits and I'll wish everyone happy holidays!
