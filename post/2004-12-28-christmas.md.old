Had a good Christmas this year.  My folks came up the Tuesday before XMas and stayed at the new house till they left this past Sunday (ie Amanda and I ran out and bought a 2nd bed the weekend before they got here).  Had a pretty good visit with them and got a chance to get my Dad's input on some household projects.

We opened our presents to each other (Amanda, my folks, and myself) Christmas Eve... my folks and Amanda liked the panoramic photos I got from [LaPayne Photography](http://www.lapayne.com/) (thanks Rachel!).  We gave my folks a fall scene for XMas, my Dad a southwest photo (Skyline Arch - Arches National Park, Utah) for his birthday (in a few weeks), and I gave Amanda a vertical panoramic with some Colorado mountains in the background and a bunch of wildflowers in the foreground.  Highlight though has to be Amanda's big gift to me... [Merry!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/52715791/in/set-1144844/)  Amanda adopted a kitty for us!  She's a cute little 6-month old kitty with tortoise shell fur and little orange tiger stripes on her cheeks.  Lots more pictures at [the kitty gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/1144844/).

Anyway, we all went over to Amanda's folks' place for Christmas Day to open stockings and presents and so forth.  My folks had a good time with Amanda's family.  Well, I should get going.  Need to call a vet and see if I can't schedule an appointment for Merry to go in and vaccinated and so forth.
