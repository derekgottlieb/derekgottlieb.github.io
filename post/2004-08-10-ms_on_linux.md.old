[So apparently](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5614334/), MS is actually testing out Linux now before making their claims that Windows is better.  The part I found most entertaining was a quote from a former IBM Linux supporter who's been hired on at MS.  "There's no set architecture in Linux.  All roads lead to madness."
