Yeah, so things have been pretty busy the past several months, and I haven't made any posts here since the fall semester started.  Anyway, just wanted to pop on here to say I went to the Liz Phair concert last night and it rocked.  Quite outstanding.  If you haven't heard her stuff, and like "chick rock", I'd suggest checking her out.  Her most recent album is more pop than her older stuff.  Apparently had the same production crew ("The Matrix") as the Avril Lavigne album.  But it's still quite good.  And her live performance is out-frigging-standing.  She's pretty funny in person.
