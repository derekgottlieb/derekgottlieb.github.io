Ran across [SwitchProxy](http://jgillick.nettripper.com/switchproxy/) for Firefox.  Looks pretty cool.  Basically you can set it up to download a list of open anonymous proxy servers, and hop between them at a specified interval (ie every minute it looks like you're surfing from a different IP).  Good deal for anyone who's a little concerned about anonymity.
