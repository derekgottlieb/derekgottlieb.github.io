So Amanda and I got back from our honeymoon in Ireland Monday night.  We pretty much up and died when we got home.  Very long day.  Spent yesterday trying to get shifted back by 6 hours and deal with essential errands.  We've had all of Amanda's film developed onto CD, and I offloaded all of my digital pics to my computer.  The photos are largely sorted by this point, but need some cleanup before I'll put them up on the web.  I'll be trying to get those up within the next day or two.  Will likely post more later including some sort of timeline for the trip.
