Hmm.  In the same spirit as the tests at Fuali.com, I ran across this one for the show Sliders.  Man that was a good show.  Wish I had Sci-Fi so I could watch it.  Been looking around the net some, and it sounds like they're slated to release the first season on DVD in April...  That would be pretty cool.  Haven't seen that show in ages.  Oh yeah, my test results for Sliders:

Wonder if there's a test for Buffy...?
