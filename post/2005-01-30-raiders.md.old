Went to the [Castle Theater](http://www.thecastletheater.com/) in Bloomington yesterday with Amanda to see _Raiders of the Lost Ark_.  Really outstanding theater setup.  Instead of the usual uncomfortable, cramped stadium seating, the Castle has a set of squishy couches and loveseats.  Much more enjoyable experience.  _Raiders_ is such a classic.
