Just ran across an interesting [site](http://www.muchosucko.com/).  Appears to be a collection of oddball videos and such that have surfaced on the net.  For example, there's this vid of a kid going after a [pi?ata](http://www.muchosucko.com/link2503.html), and news footage of a [helicopter crash](http://www.muchosucko.com/video-coptercrash.html) (always figured they wouldn't be pretty with those giant spinning blades).  Note: definitely not work safe stuff here (there's some non kid-friendly stuff there...).
