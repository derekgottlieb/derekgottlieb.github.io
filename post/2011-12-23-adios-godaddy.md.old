I've been meaning to do this for a long time, but I'm finally doing it.  When I
first got into having a website, I'd registered my domain name with GoDaddy
based on some recommendations at the time.  Since then, I've seen a lot of
reasons to move away from them, but never quite got around to it.  But their
support for SOPA has finally pushed me to transfer my domains elsewhere.  For
now, I've moved most of my domains over to
[Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com) and the ones I couldn't over to
[Name.com](http://name.com).  I'm sure GoDaddy doesn't really give a rip that
I'm leaving (since I only had a few domains with them), but their support of
SOPA has prompted others to move 100s of domains elsewhere and some big clients
to threaten to move 100s to 1000s more if they don't change their stance on
this lousy piece of proposed legislation (e.g., see [this Reddit
thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/).

On an happier and only tangentially related note (GoDaddy - Go = Daddy), anyone
who actually reads my excuse for a blog has probably noticed the complete lack
of updates in over a year.  Turns out being a Dad pretty effectively consumes
all of your time, especially if you're trying to keep up with
