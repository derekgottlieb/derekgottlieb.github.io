Man, I'm totally looking forward to [Evil Genius](http://www.howevilareyou.com/) for the PC.  General concept reminds me of the old Dungeon Keeper series where you were an evil demon who had all sorts of minions and had to build and defend your dungeon against those darn heroes.  Used to love those games.
