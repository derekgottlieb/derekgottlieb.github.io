[This game](http://gamesdomain.yahoo.com/preview/27123) looks to be pretty sweet.  Another game in the stealth genre (ala Metal Gear), but the guy in this one wears a funky suit that lets him turn invisible when he crouches (somehow more believable than hiding in a little shadow).  He can also emulate the appearance of any character he takes a picture of.
