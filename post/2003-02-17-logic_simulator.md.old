After a little bit of work, I got the simulation of 32 input vectors in parallel up and running in my simulator.  Pretty sweet.  Shouldn't be too bad to get basic sequential circuit support added in and then I'll have done both extra credit options.  Mainly need to figure out how to time my program and the rest is trivial.  Will probably look into doing some further optimizing of my code, but seems pretty zippy for any circuit I've run it on so far.
