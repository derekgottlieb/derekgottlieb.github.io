So everyone's been raving about this [del.icio.us thing](http://del.icio.us).    Essentially, it's a big online, social bookmarking site.  You set up an account, add your bookmarks to it, and categorize them with tags of your choosing (i.e. instead of simple folders, you can associate a link with tags "programming" and "C" so that you can access it when you click on either the programming or C categories).  Social aspect comes into play when you look at who else has posted a given bookmark, or who else has posted stuff in a given category, or what the most popular links of the day are, etc etc etc.  Anyway, I've started using it and have my bookmarks set up [here](http://del.icio.us/derekgottlieb).
