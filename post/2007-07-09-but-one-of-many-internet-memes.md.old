Kait (aka [student dr. blaze](http://kkblaze.blogspot.com/)) pinged me for an internet meme she [filled out](http://kkblaze.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-fun-silly-taking-up-webspace.html).  Since I'm not sure I _know_ many people with blogs, I suppose I'll have to tap [Richy](http://thederivative.net) and see if he'll fill it out and pass it on.






  1. WERE YOU NAMED AFTER ANYONE? No


  2. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CRIED? Saturday


  3. DO YOU LIKE YOUR HANDWRITING? Yes, but I wish I could find a pen I like that'd allow me to write even smaller while maintaining legibility


  4. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LUNCH MEAT? turkey, or peanut butter


  5. DO YOU HAVE KIDS? no, just 3 crazy cats


  6. IF YOU WERE ANOTHER PERSON WOULD YOU BE FRIENDS WITH YOU? i think so.


  7. DO YOU USE SARCASM A LOT? probably less than i used to?


  8. DO YOU STILL HAVE YOUR TONSILS? yup


  9. WOULD YOU BUNGEE JUMP? jumping off a perfectly good bridge ranks up there with jumping out of a perfectly good airplane.  and by that I mean "hell no"


  10. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE CEREAL? cinnamon toast crunch.  but you have to sing the name like in the commercials


  11. DO YOU UNTIE YOUR SHOES WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OFF? i generally avoid untying shoes when i can avoid it.  if lazyness wasn't a good enough reason, the fact that one of my cats tries to kill my shoelaces when their untied (especially when I'm wiggling them about ever so tauntingly while tying them) is added motivation


  12. DO YOU THINK YOU ARE STRONG? not particularly.  but when you have to get through something, sometimes you just do.


  13. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ICE CREAM? Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby


  14. WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE ABOUT PEOPLE? hmmm... whether i think they're idiots?


  15. RED OR PINK? blue.  no yell-- auuuuuuuugh!


  16. WHAT IS YOUR LEAST FAVORITE THING ABOUT YOURSELF? hmm.  err.  ahh.  no wait... maybe... my indecisiveness?


  17. WHO DO YOU MISS THE MOST? my grandmother


  18. DO YOU WANT EVERYONE TO SEND THIS BACK TO YOU? gotta go with precedent here.  post it on your blogs & pass it on


  19. WHAT COLOR PANTS AND SHOES ARE YOU WEARING? khaki cargo shorts and barefoot


  20. WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU ATE? a Kashi chewy Trail Mix granola bar


  21. WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW? The Pipettes - Dirty Mind


  22. IF YOU WHERE A CRAYON, WHAT COLOR WOULD YOU BE? given the standard crayolas, I'd probably also go with midnight blue.  although maybe i'd go with brooding gray if we were talking about [emo crayons](http://www.emostudent.com/?p=12) :)


  23. WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE SMELLS? baking goodness... yeasty bread, cookies... mmmm


  24. WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON YOU TALKED TO ON THE PHONE? my folks


  25. DO YOU LIKE THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS TO YOU? but of course.  why else would i fill this out if i didn't.


  26. FAVORITE SPORTS TO WATCH? battling robots.  battlebots was pretty sweet when it first aired, but promptly got lame as you saw 20 different variants of the same 1 or 2 robot ideas.  maybe it was all the limitations placed on weapons (no projectiles, flamethrowers, etc)


  27. HAIR COLOR? brown with an increasingly liberal sprinkling of gray


  28. EYE COLOR? some sort of blue hazel type deal


  29. ARE YOU: OVERWEIGHT, UNDERWEIGHT, JUST RIGHT, OR NEVER RIGHT? still over, but much much better than i had been, and i've managed to maintain what i've gotten down to without significantly denying myself tasty eats or working out as much as i had been


  30. DO YOU WEAR CONTACTS? nope, just glasses for distance when I'm driving


  31. FAVORITE FOOD? ouch.  have to pick just one?  i guess i'd have to say papa del's pan pizza.  BEST EVER!


  32. SCARY MOVIES OR HAPPY ENDINGS? i like to mix it up.  the american movie-going public seems to need happy endings, so i guess i'd say scary movies.  they're either "re-animator funny" or sometimes, maybe, creep me out a bit which is always entertaining


  33. LAST MOVIE YOU WATCHED? heat (1995 - de niro, pacino, val kilmer, jon voight, tom sizemore, ashley judd, natalie portman... kickass)


  34. WHAT COLOR SHIRT ARE YOU WEARING? green polo with white stripes


  35. SUMMER OR WINTER? suppose i'd say a winter if i had to choose.  always liked the peace of it.


  36. HUGS OR KISSES? hugs, definitely


  37. FAVORITE DESSERT? maybe some good soft, chewy, fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies


  38. WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING NOW? i'm actually between books at the moment after having re-read the dragon reborn, and the two books rachel gave us (life of pi and the curious incident of the dog in the night-time)


  39. WHAT IS ON YOUR MOUSE PAD? generally use the trackpad on the macbook pro, a trackball at a desktop, and on rare occasions (e.g. when gaming on the mbp) a portable mouse sans mousepad.  just don't care for mice all that much, and don't care for the restrictions imposed by a mousepad


  40. WHAT DID YOU WATCH ON T. V. LAST NIGHT? a couple of shows on the national geographic channel... [science of speed eating](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/ET/popup/200707082100.html) and [hooked: monster fish](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/ET/popup/200707082200.html)


  41. FAVORITE SOUND? a well-played acoustic guitar


  42. ROLLING STONES OR BEATLES? beatles


  43. WHAT IS THE FARTHEST YOU HAVE BEEN FROM HOME/HERE? Hong Kong

  46. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE VACATION SPOT? rather enjoyed Ireland, and would love to go back some day


  47. WHAT'S THE ONE THING THAT YOU'VE BEEN DYING TO DO BUT HAVEN'T DONE YET? crap, i don't know.  have a real job?


  48. WHAT'S THE ONE SIMPLE THING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY? amanda's laugh


  49. HAVE YOU EVER TRULY BEEN IN LOVE? yes.  or did you miss the part where i'm married :)


  50. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE BOOK/AUTHOR? always enjoy Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series (although the series was dragging a bit before the most recent book)


  51. WHERE IS YOUR FAVORITE PLACE TO BE? sitting by a window on a rainy day


  52. WHAT'S YOUR PERSONAL THEME SONG? currently: the reputation - face it


  53. ARE YOU REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN, A DEMOCRAT, OR AN INDEPENDENT? think i'm registered independent, but most of those bastards are ... bastards.  barak obama at least seems promising


  54. WHEN YOU WERE A KID, HOW DID YOU SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME? video games


  55. WHAT IS THE AIR-SPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW? i don't know that -- auuuuuuuugh!
