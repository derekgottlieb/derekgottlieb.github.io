So it seems LBB (that's Little Boy Blazejack) has finally come into his own.  If you don't know him, he's the "little" brother of someone I went to high school with.  Those of us who knew him always wondered if he would eventually find himself gainfully employed and at the same time doing something he enjoyed.  Last I knew, I think he was getting ready to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a major in photojournalism.  Looks like it suits him.  I did a little digging and have run across a fair number of sports-related shots.  He's got a sample of his portfolio over at [Sports Shooter](http://www.sportsshooter.com/members.html?id=3895), has several photos that appear in the [Ka Leo O Hawaii](http://www.kaleo.org) University newspaper, and has even had some of his stuff picked up by the [Star Bulletin](http://www.starbulletin.com/2004/12/16/sports/story1.html) (Honolulu's paper).  Very cool I say.
