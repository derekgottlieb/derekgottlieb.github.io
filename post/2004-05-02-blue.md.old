So I've finally decided the previous color scheme for Malkier was a little too bleak.  And I've been doing the whole black background thing for a bit too long (started way back in undergrad when everyone had plain grey backgrounds or awful background images and almost no one went black).  Hopefully the new scheme is a little more festive... although I'm not quite happy with it yet.  And I finally got around to installing my own copy of my blog software (the old stuff was provided by the host and didn't allow me to customize the comments pages, or really control the blog as much as I would've liked).
