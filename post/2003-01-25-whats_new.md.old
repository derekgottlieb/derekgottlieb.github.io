So what all is new in my life at the moment:

  * Broke down and bought a Pioneer DVR-105 (4x DVD-R/2x DVD-RW) burner.  Now if only I could get media for it...

  * Been enjoying the Back to the Future trilogy on DVD.  That DeLorean is SO COOL!

  * Oh, and I've finally started work again on AMALSIM.  Just committed a whole boatload of changes into the repository.  Mmmmm... 64-bit cycle counts.
