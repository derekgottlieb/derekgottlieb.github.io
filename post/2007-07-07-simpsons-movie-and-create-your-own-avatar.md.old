So the Simpsons are headed for movie theaters everywhere toward the end of the month.  Supposedly it's good, but I think I'll wait for the rental.  What prompts me to write this post however is one of the features available on the movie [website](http://simpsonsmovie.com/)... create your own Simpsons avatar!  Reasonably well done Flash affair where you select body type, hairstyle, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, etc.  There's of course only a limited number of each of these, but you can achieve a fairly reasonable likeness and save it out as a jpeg.  I took a stab at making mine and here it is:

To be honest, I think it's pretty cool and might use the head as my new IM icon and maybe slap it at the top of the right column of the blog where people sometimes put a "photo of the author."

In case you're wondering, I didn't select the blowfish due to its connection to the Simpsons (does it have one?  many of the shirt options seemed to, but I don't know what it is for that one).  In fact, I selected it because I the other choices didn't "speak to me" and cartoon blowfish always make me think of the [OpenSSH](http://openssh.org/) mascot.

And yes, Virginia, I realize I'm a dork. :)
