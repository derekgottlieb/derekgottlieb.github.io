So in my Christmas stocking this year I got a [Mitch Hedberg](http://www.mitchhedberg.net/) CD, _Strategic Grill Locations_.  I'd seen him on Comedy Central some time back and found him absolutely hilarious.  He's got this funny, stoner sort of vibe and just cranks out all sorts of oddball, inane comments that are really entertaining.  If you are a follower of my blog, you may have already noticed that I have a number of his quotes that randomly appear in the sidebar.  While they're funny, they just aren't the same until you've seen his routine.  After that, you can just picture him.  I've actually caught myself laughing out loud while driving in the car listening to this guy.  If you get a chance, check out his stuff some time (Comedy Central airs his special every so often).  Now I have to go out and get his other CD, _All Together_, which includes a DVD with an uncut/unedited version of his Comedy Central special.
