So Lego's working on a video game set in the Lego Star Wars universe (ie Star Wars setting, but stuff is built out of Legos).   They have some coverage over at [Gamespot](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/legostarwars/preview_6114511.html), including screenshots.  Looks like it should be a pretty cute game, and the initial hands-on demo is impressive.
