I've seen a few of these around town.  Apparently the park district is spinning them as restoring some of the land controlled by the park district to it's original "prairie" condition.  In practice, I think this largely translates to "um, this is too much work, so we're just going to stop mowing some of these and put up a sign."  I've always found the park district to be rather interesting around here.  They've got all sorts of little plots scattered throughout town that they're responsible for, some as small as a few flower pots sitting on a sidewalk (think they called that a "flower island" or something like that), many of them not much more than a 5-foot x 5-foot square (think they call them "mini-parks").  They have a number of more substantial parks scattered about town, much more than I would really expect for a town of this size, which is cool.  I still find some of it a little absurd though.
