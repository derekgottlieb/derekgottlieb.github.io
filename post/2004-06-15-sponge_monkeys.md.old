So I ran across [this post](http://ad-rag.com/109125.php) over at adland about the Quiznos Sponge Monkeys.  I've been wondering where on earth they came up with those brilliant, bizarre, singing critters.  So freakin' hilarious.  Anyway, the ads are done by [this guy](http://www.rathergood.com/) as demonstrated by this other webshort of his about [the moon](http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song/).  Doesn't look like everyone over at adland appreciates them though... since they seem to have confused the little furry critters with rats which they don't think are appropriate in food ads...
