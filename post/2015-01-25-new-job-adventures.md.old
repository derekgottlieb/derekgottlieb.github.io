About six months ago, I took a new job and left the position I'd held at the Alabama Supercomputer Center for roughly seven years. I've struggled whether I should write a post about why I chose to leave my old job or focus on the positive and talk about my new job. If you're curious, [this article at the Washington Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/fedbiz_daily/2014/04/morale-problems-at-csc-employees-sound-off.html?full=true) covers some of the shenanigans that motivated me to leave my job with CSC.

In spite of all of that, I still struggled with the decision to leave. ASC's mission to support the educational community in Alabama was a big part of what motivated me every day. I like the people I worked with, but during my time there I went from being mostly indifferent about CSC to being somewhat ashamed to say that I worked for them.

But on to the good news. Last July I started a new job at [Digium](http://www.digium.com), a small telecommunications company in Huntsville. You might be wondering why a company that makes PBX phone systems and drives the development of [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org) would need someone with my background. Turns out they acquired a cloud services company toward the end of 2013 that was selling PBXs on their OpenStack infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure isn't all that different from an HPC compute cluster that's picked a different spot in the cost / performance / reliability design space, unless you're building an HPC cloud. 

It's been a hoot so far and Amanda's commented on the improvement in my mood so I guess it shows. My new role is more development-focused, so I don't have to worry about day to day operations as much. We rolled out our first project that affects customers about a week ago. We automated the ordering of phone number and provisioning of SIP trunks (a VOIP phone line that can support multiple simultaneous calls) when a customer orders one on the website. They should be publicly announcing another of our projects later this week, so I should be able to talk about that soon.
