So, Amanda and I closed on the new house yesterday morning.  We're already starting to feel like homeowners.  And by that, I mean we've already started tearing the place apart. :)  For those that are interested, I've got some pictures up over in the [gallery](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/1142478/) (taken with the new [Digital Rebel](/blog/2004/09/16/digital-rebel)).
