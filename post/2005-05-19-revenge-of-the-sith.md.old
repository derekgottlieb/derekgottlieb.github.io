Star Wars: Episode III is out!  And it's supposed to be good.  Very dark, but good.  I've heard it actually does a good job wrapping things up and bridging the new with the old.  Hopefully I'll get to see it before too long (headed out of town to go to Amanda's cousin's wedding tomorrow and my folks will be here next week).  Of course, I've heard a fairly high quality work print has [been leaked](http://www.macned.nl/news.php?id=1835).
