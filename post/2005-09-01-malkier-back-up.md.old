Finally got the site back up.  Turns out there was some sort of security breach this past weekend that slipped evil javascript into all of my php/html pages on the site.  Looked like it was intended to be some sort of browser buffer overflow attack or something along those lines (the support folk at ipowerweb said it would download a virus?).  Anyway, things should be cleared up and safe again for now.  Wish I knew why I was so lucky.  Really doesn't seem like it should've taken this long to get things sorted out if the admins were on the ball, but what do I know.
