Had an entertaining conversation with Jeff yesterday.  Somehow we got on the topic of ECE291 and his team project.  And how most of the rest of his team was pretty worthless.  Anyway, he googled himself and showed me the webpage that the team made for their project.  Turns out Gel (from IMSA) was on his team.  So we started talking about her.  So I guess Jeff was getting a little peeved by his team members and wasn't convinced they were putting any effort into the project.  And Gel had a webcam set up in her dormroom at that time.  And Jeff would check it sometimes to see if she was working on the project.  And one time I guess she had just returned from the shower and wasn't particularly careful with her towel.  So Jeff got a hint of towel and a whole lotta eyeful of Gel.  Pretty damn funny.
