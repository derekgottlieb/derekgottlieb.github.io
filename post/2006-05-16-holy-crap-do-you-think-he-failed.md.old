Apparently the guy drove all the way into the waiting area.  Like ALL the way.  I thought this stuff was reserved for South Floridians...  And is it just me, or is that a really strange, terse blurb the news people put on their website?  Although, they appear to be the only ones who've bothered to put this up on the web so far, so I guess I can't complain too much.
