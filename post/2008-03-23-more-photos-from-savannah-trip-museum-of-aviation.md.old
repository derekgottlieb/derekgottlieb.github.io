On the drive back from Savannah, Charles and I quickly stopped in to visit the [Robins Air Force Base Museum of Aviation](http://www.museumofaviation.org).  Didn't spend very long there, but it wasn't too much out of the way for the drive back and had a chance to take a few pics.  There were some more unusual planes there that I'd meant to go back and look up info on, but obviously hadn't since I only just pulled the photos off my camera a few days ago with the rest of the photos from Savannah.
