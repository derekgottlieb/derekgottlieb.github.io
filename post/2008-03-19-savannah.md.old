Took a trip for work back in December to provide cluster training for some of the engineers at [Gulfstream](http://www.gulfaero.com/).  Seems like we also did some very minor maintenance on the cluster we administer there.  Anyway, I brought the camera along and had a chance to take a few pics while wandering around the riverfront.  Only got around to pulling them off my camera today, so here they are:
