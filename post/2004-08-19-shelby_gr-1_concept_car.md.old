Watched a little bit of the Speed network recently, and caught a documentary type show on [Carroll Shelby](http://www.carrollshelby.com/).  Basically, he's responsible for the monster known as the Cobra (dropping a powerful Ford V-8 into a small/light AC body).  Kicked some serious butt in racing for quite a while.  After that, he's done several additional iterations/refinements to the basic Cobra idea and worked with Ford on some more performance oriented versions of their Mustang and so forth.  Anyway, ran across [this gallery](http://www.seriouswheels.com/top-Ford-Shelby-GR-1-Concept.htm) of wallpapers of the Ford Shelby GR-1 Concept.  Pretty cool.
