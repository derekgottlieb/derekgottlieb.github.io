So it seems some of the spammers have picked up on my blog for some reason.  I've started receiving a lot of very spammy comments as of recent (ie one "person" slowly iterating over all blog posts starting at #1, each post being largely nonsense but containing a gambling link in the homepage section).  So I've turned on comment moderation for anything phishy.  With any luck this will at least prevent anything from ever showing up on the blog itself, but it still means I'll get alerts about them (which I may eventually turn off if it grows to frequent) and have to go through and clear them out every so often.  Isn't the internet grand?
