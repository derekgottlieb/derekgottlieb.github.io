[manscaping](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Manscaping):
to groom a man.  Shaving, waxing, cleaning up the superfluous fur.

Courtest of the [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/).Â  A collaborative (think wikipedia) dictionary for modern slang.Â  Found out about this earlier this week on [the Rep](http://www.reputationmusic.com) yahoo group.Â  Since a lot of slang is a bit crude in nature, I don't have to warn you that this site may offend some of the prudish folk out there.Â  You've been warned...Â  I could probably spend all day looking through that site.
