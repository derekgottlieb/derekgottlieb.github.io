Surprise!  We'd been up to Vanderbilt for our last clinic visit before the planned c-section and had just finished our tour of L&D; and were walking to the car to head home when baby Adelaide must've decided she liked the place so much she wanted to stay.  Amanda's water broke and so we went right back in and now baby Addy's here!  She was born @ 13:01 on the 17th and weighed in at a healthy 6 lbs 11 oz at 19 1/w inches.  Not bad for 4 weeks early!
