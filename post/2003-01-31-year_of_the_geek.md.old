So, it looks like 2003 might be the year of the geek.  At least as far as movies go.  We've got the Matrix sequels (Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions).  We've got the final installment of the LOTR trilogy.  We've got the third Harry Potter movie.  And we've got a slew of Marvel comic movies coming out (The Hulk, X-Men 2, Daredevil).  Lookin' pretty sweet if I do say so myself.
