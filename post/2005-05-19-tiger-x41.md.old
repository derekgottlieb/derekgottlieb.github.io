As I suspected, the 10.4.1 update for Tiger has [been released](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosxupdate1041.html).  Looks like they've fixed quite a number of things (seems to have possibly solved some of the crashes/lockups I'd experienced so far... at least, don't think I've had one since I updated).
