Well, I finally did it.  I signed myself for an actual, bonafide web hosting
service.  No more being limited to what will fit on my University server (and
having to move that every so often) or running off my Linux box over really
slow uplink.  I'm still in the process of moving in (which will involve a
rework of my website to some extent), but have managed to relocate my [blog]() 
and start transferring some of the pictures in my [gallery](http://flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb).  Seems pretty slick so far.
Since I'm technically on Spring Break, I'll hopefully have a chance to tinker
with it a bit this week and get settled in a bit more.  

In case you were curious, I finally settled on [Malkier](http://malkier.com)
which is the name of a place in the [Wheel of Time](http://www.tor.com/jordan/)
series of fantasy books by Robert Jordan.  It's a cool series if you haven't
read it.  It's getting a little long-winded, but still quite good.
