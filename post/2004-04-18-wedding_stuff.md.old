So I've spent a good portion of the weekend working on getting wedding invites/response cards printed up on my old laser.  Not to toot my own horn, but I think they turned out pretty cool.  The font Amanda used (A Yummy Apology) went really well with her watercolor flowers and the deckled edges on the paper (scares me that I know what that means).  Anyway, they're pretty cool and should be spooling up to send them all out before much longer.
