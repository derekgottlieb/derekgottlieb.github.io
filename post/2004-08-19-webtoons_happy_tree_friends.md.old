Who can forget the [Happy Tree Friends](http://www.happytreefriends.com/) when they're talking about bizarre little WebToons?  The series consists of a bunch of shorts of little cute fuzzy animals meeting their demise in a disturbing manner.  Fun for the whole family.  I also ran across [this site](http://oasi.upc.es/~kiusap/flash/happy_tree_friends/) that appeared to have all of the episodes available for convenient viewing (I don't think the official site has all of the older ones).  These toons have even come out on [DVD](http://store.yahoo.com/mondomedia-store/firstblooddvd.html) if you can believe it (that's how I first saw them).
