So I broke down and bought a new mp3 player to take with me when I go jogging... well jogging/walking...  well really more walking than jogging, but I'm still building up toward that.  Anyway, looks like it should be a pretty cute little unit.  Key features:




  * It's about a 1" cube


  * has a little OLED display


  * comes in 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB versions (I got the 512)


  * has an FM radio (can even record it at up to 160kbps)


  * 8-10 hours of battery life when playing mp3s


  * USB2.0 and looks like any other flash drive when you connect it to a computer



Seems pretty slick, and operates at the same price point as the iPod shuffle.  Oh, and it also supports WMA and DRMed WMA for whatever that's worth.  And it's sold exclusively at Walmart of all places.
