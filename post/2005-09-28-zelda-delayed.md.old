How lame!  I've talked about this game a little [previously](/blog/2005/03/15/zelda-trailers), and it's looking pretty oustanding.  They've gone back to more of a realistic look from the cel-shaded cartoony stuff of Wind Waker.  Not that Wind Waker wasn't cool.  But it sounds like it's getting pushed back from November to some time after next March or so (according to [IGN](http://cube.ign.com/articles/642/642238p1.html)).  Man, this was announced back in August.  Where was I?  I'm really looking forward to this game too.  Amanda and I had even preordered it for my birthday.  Bummer.
