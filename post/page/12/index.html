                <p>Took a vacation of sorts down to SoFlo (hey, SoCal&rsquo;s accepted, why not SoFlo for the sunshine state?) with Amanda to visit the folk this past week for Thanksgiving and Birthdays and so forth. Really spent a fair portion of my time going through the crap in my room from my childhood. Not so fun and I&rsquo;m surprised Amanda didn&rsquo;t kill me for wasting her limited vacation time in this manner, but at least we got to go to Monkey Jungle.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/10/25/bad-computer-mojo/'><h1>Bad Computer Mojo</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>I&rsquo;ve been suffering from some bad computer mojo as of recent.
 First our group fileserver tanked. Not that I really came into physical contact with it, but I talked to it over the network all the time. Then my brand spankin' new NAS drive (got a Buffalo LinkStation, basically an external hard drive enclosure with ethernet instead of USB/Firewire) had some sort of catastrophic firmware failure while I was using it and I was forced to RMA it.</p>

                <p>What an unbelievable waste of time. Some state law passed last year (at least I assume last year&hellip; I started having to do this last year anyway) requires that all state employees must go through ethics training every year. Interesting how grad students are considered employees when it means additional requirements/constraints be placed on us and students when they&rsquo;re talking about salary/benefits/parking/etc. Fortunately it&rsquo;s done through the web instead of requiring us to attend an actual class.</p>

                <p>Heard this great quote from the late/great Seymour Cray: &ldquo;If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use: Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?&rdquo; Apparently he said this in response to a question about the growing use of large clusters of commodity PCs for supercomputing applications. Traditional wisdom would suggest it&rsquo;s much better to design the heck out of two very powerful processors and ease the parallel programming burden to achieve high performance.</p>

                <p>Looks like Apple has finally realized that there are a lot of people who would like a high res notebook. Previously, their &ldquo;pro&rdquo; line of notebooks (aka PowerBooks) topped out at a piddly 1440x900 on a 17&quot; LCD. Just think about that a moment. My Thinkbrick (that&rsquo;s a couple years old at this point) does 1400x1050 on a 14&quot; display. Their 15&quot; was equally pathetic at 1280x854. They&rsquo;ve just bumped up the 15&quot; model to 1440x960 and the 17&quot; to 1680x1050.</p>

                <p>So far everyone in our bunch (Amanda, yours truly, Katie and Amanda&rsquo;s Mom) seems pretty pleased with Verizon. My phone actually tanked this morning&hellip; Picked it up to head off to work when I noticed it wasn&rsquo;t on. Tried to turn it and and it wouldn&rsquo;t. Figured battery&rsquo;s just dead. So I plug it in real quick and it powers up. Starts the charging procedure and quickly says the battery&rsquo;s fully charged?</p>

                <p>I should really pay closer attention to who joins our department. Nikita Borisov apparently just started here this semester and is currently doing work on anonymous peer-to-peer networks. Nick introduced him to Jeff and I today with the intention of giving him some of our spare computers to get his group started.
Afterwards I took a look at his past work and realized he was one of the primary architects for Off-the-Record Messaging that I use in Gaim (Linux/Windows) and AdiumX (OSX).</p>

                <p>Sanjay&rsquo;s in this month&rsquo;s issue of CPU Magazine talking about life at AGEIA. Pretty neat! For those not in the know, Sanjay&rsquo;s a professor in the ECE department here at UIUC and has been working as chief architect at AGEIA for a while now. AGEIA has been developing a custom physics processor to improve gaming performance/experience by pushing all such calculations onto a dedicated chip thus freeing up the cpu and the gpu to do what they do best (ie handle the ai and such and push pixels).</p>

                <p>What&rsquo;s the deal with stupid people getting union secretary gigs in Universities? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve met some great and helpful secretaries in my time. But so many of them are just so useless! I&rsquo;ve been dealing a bit with one in the business office for our department trying to place orders for my students in senior design. Here are my two experiences so far:
 Took a couple of days to get my first order placed.</p>

                <p>Fairly recently, the company that made our group fileserver was bought up by Sun. So we&rsquo;re not really sure whether we&rsquo;ll be able to renew our service contract (which runs out October 20th), or if we&rsquo;ll be forced to buy a new Sun fileserver at a discount. The cynic in all of us should know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip;
On Friday, our group fileserver sorta flaked. Took the admins an hour or more to get it back up and running, and when it did our current group mount (ie the one with all the stuff I really care about right now) did not come up with it.</p>
