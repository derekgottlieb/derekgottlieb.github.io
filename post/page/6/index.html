                <p>So my hosting provider (was textdrive, now Joyent) is working on retiring all their old FreeBSD servers they were leasing. Yeah, it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me that you could lease a server like that. Anyway, they&rsquo;re buying up fancy &ldquo;Shared Accelerators&rdquo; (8-core Opteron boxes with 4GB RAM/core from Sun running OpenSolaris) backed by SunFire x4500 Thumpers running ZFS.
I&rsquo;d started off with this provider a couple years ago as part of a VC campaign (give us a large wad of cash, and we&rsquo;ll give you an account for as long as we&rsquo;re in business), and I&rsquo;d upgraded at some point when they had a similar campaign that bumped up the specs on my hosting account and added their Connector service (group email, calendar, etc services with their own chunk of attached storage) and Strongspace service (large reliable online backup storage accessible via sftp/rsync over ssh/web over ssl).</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year. Time to watch favorites like &ldquo;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&rdquo; (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron Howard) and &ldquo;A Christmas Story&rdquo; (they looked at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears!). Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me before I had a chance to notice. Fortunately I was able to get the little bit of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as I had feared.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m finally getting around to sifting through some of the photos I&rsquo;ve taken over the past couple of months and uploading them to Flickr. Here&rsquo;s the one from the first batch taken at Cathedral Caverns in Scottsboro, AL:
And here are some shots I took of the Autumn trees from up on Monte Sano:
And a few shots of our pumpkins from Halloween:</p>

                <p>We&rsquo;ve been here in Alabama for 2 weeks now. Things seem to be going pretty well so far. We somehow survived the move and I don&rsquo;t think left anything too critical behind. The truck full of half our stuff (and pulling the Civic), the CRV full of cats and guitars, and all the occupants got down here safely and relatively uneventfully. The POD full of the other half of our stuff arrived this past Thursday and we&rsquo;re slowly working on unloading it.</p>

                <p>Apparently it&rsquo;s been a busy week for my flickr photos. I&rsquo;ve had two that were selected for inclusion in various web things.
First, one of my Ireland honeymoon photos was selected for inclusion in Schmap Dublin Third Edition (check out Literary Dublin: Trinity College). Oddly enough, it was a photo I took while we were wandering around Trinity College. Here&rsquo;s a little descriptive blurb from their website:
Exploring a Schmap Guide is a uniquely interactive experience: maps and guide content are dynamically integrated, allowing intuitive, real-time access to reviews and photo slideshows for places of interest.</p>

                <p>Amanda and I are buying a new house. In a land far far from CU&hellip; Huntsville, AL to be exact&hellip; or technically Madison, AL to be even more exact (suburb to the west of Huntsville).
No, Derek didn&rsquo;t graduate. While one could ask &ldquo;why is he leaving sans-degree&rdquo;, a better question might be &ldquo;why is he referring to himself in the third person?&rdquo; To put it simply, I just got fed up with how things have been going (or not going to be more precise) and decided it was time for a change.</p>

You are a movie buff of the most obsessive variety. If a movie exists, chances are that you&rsquo;ve seen it.
You&rsquo;re an expert on movie facts and trivia. It&rsquo;s hard to stump you with a question about film.
Are You a Movie Buff?
Response from anyone who knows me:
well, duh. of course you&rsquo;re a movie geek.</p>
