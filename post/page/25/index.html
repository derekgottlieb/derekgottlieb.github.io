                <p>Who can forget the Happy Tree Friends when they&rsquo;re talking about bizarre little WebToons? The series consists of a bunch of shorts of little cute fuzzy animals meeting their demise in a disturbing manner. Fun for the whole family. I also ran across this site that appeared to have all of the episodes available for convenient viewing (I don&rsquo;t think the official site has all of the older ones). These toons have even come out on DVD if you can believe it (that&rsquo;s how I first saw them).</p>

                <p>So apparently, MS is actually testing out Linux now before making their claims that Windows is better. The part I found most entertaining was a quote from a former IBM Linux supporter who&rsquo;s been hired on at MS. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no set architecture in Linux. All roads lead to madness.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Looks like someone heard me. There&rsquo;s now a mod out there for Doom 3 that attaches a small flashlight to the shotgun and machinegun. Claims to be using Duct Tape.</p>

                <p>Looks like EA has pushed back the release of Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault to some time in November. Guess they&rsquo;re adding some form of squad control (basic orders like advance, fall back, suppressive fire, etc) and some general polishing.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/08/06/doom/'><h1>Doom!</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been playing Doom 3 off and on most of this week. If you like the Doom series, this is a welcome refresher. The graphics are pretty tight (although I don&rsquo;t actually have a machine set up that&rsquo;s fast enough to really crank it up beyond the lowest possible settings&hellip; I do have most of the effects like bump mapping and stuff turned on though). Gameplay is pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect from a Doom game, but I kinda like the combo of the dark environment and having to use a flashlight (which looks pretty damn good).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/08/06/the_screensavers/'><h1>The Screensavers</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been pretty religiously watching The Screensavers on G4/TechTV since I noticed the cable company added it to the lineup. Pretty entertaining show, and they sometimes have some cool bits on there. This past week they had a Best of: Free and Cheap episode detailing a number of free/cheap downloads and tips. I found a couple of segments of particular interest:
Linksys WRT54G - a lot of the Linksys network hardware runs Linux, and so they&rsquo;ve had to release the source under GPL.</p>

                <p>Ok. So I was poking around Gamestop, and ran across this. Can you believe it? For those of you who just couldn&rsquo;t get enough leather, a leather computer mouse?
Anyway, I can&rsquo;t wait till Doom 3 hits shelves, hopefully tomorrow. Now I just have to wait for Half-Life 2, which looks awesome.</p>

                <p>This game looks to be pretty sweet. Another game in the stealth genre (ala Metal Gear), but the guy in this one wears a funky suit that lets him turn invisible when he crouches (somehow more believable than hiding in a little shadow). He can also emulate the appearance of any character he takes a picture of.</p>
