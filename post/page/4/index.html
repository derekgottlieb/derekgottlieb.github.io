                <p><p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for a long time, but I&rsquo;m finally doing it.  When I
first got into having a website, I&rsquo;d registered my domain name with GoDaddy
based on some recommendations at the time.  Since then, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of
reasons to move away from them, but never quite got around to it.  But their
support for SOPA has finally pushed me to transfer my domains elsewhere.  For
now, I&rsquo;ve moved most of my domains over to
<a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> and the ones I couldn&rsquo;t over to
<a href="http://name.com">Name.com</a>.  I&rsquo;m sure GoDaddy doesn&rsquo;t really give a rip that
I&rsquo;m leaving (since I only had a few domains with them), but their support of
SOPA has prompted others to move 100s of domains elsewhere and some big clients
to threaten to move 100s to 1000s more if they don&rsquo;t change their stance on
this lousy piece of proposed legislation (e.g., see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/">this Reddit
thread</a>.</p></p>

                <p>Surprise! We&rsquo;d been up to Vanderbilt for our last clinic visit before the planned c-section and had just finished our tour of L&amp;D; and were walking to the car to head home when baby Adelaide must&rsquo;ve decided she liked the place so much she wanted to stay. Amanda&rsquo;s water broke and so we went right back in and now baby Addy&rsquo;s here! She was born @ 13:01 on the 17th and weighed in at a healthy 6 lbs 11 oz at 19 1/w inches.</p>

                <p><p>So this upcoming week is the big annual supercomputing convention,
<a href="http://sc10.supercomputing.org">SC10</a>, down in New Orleans.  Since I&rsquo;m
skipping out (anxiously waiting for the arrival of Little Miss Sunshine), I&rsquo;ve
got time to actually try and read through the slew of new product announcements
and news coverage.  So today I saw this quote on twitter from
<a href="http://twitter.com/hpc_guru">hpc_guru</a> and just had to share:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cost of the building next generation of supercomputers is not the problem. The cost of running the machines is what concerns engineers.&rdquo;</p>

                <p><p>So last November, I finally got a smartphone (through work no less).  Gotta
love not having to pay that monthly phone+data bill.  The iPhone always had a
lot of appeal to me, but the thought of having to switch to AT&amp;T wasn&rsquo;t
especially attractive to me.  I&rsquo;m not big on the restrictions Verizon usually
places on their phones (let&rsquo;s disable all the features of your phone out so we
can force you to use an expensive VZW service instead and nickle-and-dime you
to death).  But it&rsquo;s hard to beat their coverage.  Long story short (too late),
I ended up with a Motorola Droid running Google&rsquo;s Android OS.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been a happy happy joy joy subscriber at eMusic since 2005. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I thought initially when Lee clued me into it (indie music being a new thing for me), but after that first month I was hooked. Took me a few months and then I bumped up to the annual subscription option. Until recently, my most recent subscription plan worked out to $16/month, which got me 90 tracks a month.</p>

                <p>Well this is certainly not something I expected. SGI is one of the few HPC vendors out there that I&rsquo;m aware of who are still doing neat things with hardware. We&rsquo;ve got some of their large SMP Itanium boxes on the floor where I work, and I think they&rsquo;re pretty slick machines. Pricy, but slick. And so far their support is about the best I&rsquo;ve dealt with. That&rsquo;s not saying their perfect (try getting a CXFS guru on the phone when you need one without sitting on a major outage for several hours), but they generally seem better than most of the other HPC vendors I&rsquo;ve worked with (IBM, Cray).</p>
