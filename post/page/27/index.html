                <p>So I ran across this post over at adland about the Quiznos Sponge Monkeys. I&rsquo;ve been wondering where on earth they came up with those brilliant, bizarre, singing critters. So freakin&rsquo; hilarious. Anyway, the ads are done by this guy as demonstrated by this other webshort of his about the moon. Doesn&rsquo;t look like everyone over at adland appreciates them though&hellip; since they seem to have confused the little furry critters with rats which they don&rsquo;t think are appropriate in food ads&hellip;</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/25/os_x/'><h1>OS X</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Looks like you actually can emulate a PPC on an x86 well enough to install OS X. It&rsquo;s still a little on the slow side (basic emulation results in 500:1 slowdown over the host processor, while their JIT compiler for x86 brings that up to more like 40:1 slowdown since they cache the translated code), but the project seems pretty active, and there&rsquo;s lots of room for improvement. Still pretty need to see Mac OS X running on a PC (either Windows or Linux, but I&rsquo;ve just tried Linux at this point).</p>

                <p>I must be in one heck of a blogging mood today. I saw this Slashdot post and thought it sounded pretty sweet. Turns out, they&rsquo;ve released a GPL&rsquo;d PPC emulator for x86 that is actually capable of booting OS X. Here&rsquo;s the OS-News article that includes all the pretty pictures. Sounds like it&rsquo;s still got a few problems (reviewer ran into a few infinite loop explosions once OS X had started, and it guzzles the whole CPU), but it actually kinda worked.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/19/fedora_core_2/'><h1>Fedora Core 2</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So Fedora Core 2 is officially out. I actually snagged it a few days early thanks to this Slashdot post that included this friendly torrent. Spent a while getting it up and running under VMware and it looked pretty good. Just when I starting to think about updating my RH9 box, the computer up and imploded on me. I&rsquo;m not sure what happened, but suddenly X refused to start and I couldn&rsquo;t even get it to give me access to a text console so that I could back everything up and reinstall.</p>

                <p>So I was kinda curious what the story was behind the name for FC2 (Tettnang). Honestly, I was a little curious about FC1 (Yarrow), but never looked into it. Historically, Redhat has largely stuck with a naming convention where each release name relates to the immediate predecessor in some way, but not that predecessor&rsquo;s predecessor (grandparent?). Anyway, this page at the Fedora site seems to cover it to some extent, and here&rsquo;s a little more discussion on what some of those release names mean (and how they relate) (even more here).</p>

                <p>Here&rsquo;s a silly little webpage I Richy clued me into. It supposedly predicts your ideal career based on your name (since it&rsquo;s probably based on some sort of hash function or something, inclusion of middle and/or last name may improve your career path). For example:
Derek, Your ideal jobs is a Kids TV Presenter Derek Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a Bearded Lady in the circus. Derek Brendan Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a Office numpty.</p>

                <p>So recently I&rsquo;ve been watching some webtoons done by Amy Winfrey (works as an animator for South Park), and they&rsquo;re pretty cute. I started watching her current toon, Making Fiends, that revolves around two little girls, Vendetta and Charlotte, who go to school together. Vendetta makes all sorts of fiends and attempts to intimidate and destroy Charlotte, while Charlotte&rsquo;s busy making friends. That led me to her previous set of toons, MuffinFilms, which are a variety of short animations involving muffins.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/14/a4_paper/'><h1>A4 paper</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I finally have the remotest clue what the deal is with A4 paper (and as a result why the rest of the world feels the need to use it and screw up my print jobs, and make life difficult in LaTeX sometimes). Basically, there&rsquo;s a slashdot post on it that points to this page that discusses some of the ideas behind why A4 is the size it is. Apparently all metric paper has a height-to-width ratio of the square root of 2.</p>
