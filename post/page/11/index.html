                <p>manscaping: to groom a man. Shaving, waxing, cleaning up the superfluous fur.
Courtest of the Urban Dictionary. A collaborative (think wikipedia) dictionary for modern slang. Found out about this earlier this week on the Rep yahoo group. Since a lot of slang is a bit crude in nature, I don&rsquo;t have to warn you that this site may offend some of the prudish folk out there. You&rsquo;ve been warned&hellip; I could probably spend all day looking through that site.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2006/02/22/kitty-part-trois/'><h1>Kitty part trois</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>We adopted our third kitty this past Saturday thanks to Amanda&rsquo;s sister Katie. She&rsquo;d found him as a stray hanging around the house of some of her boyfriend&rsquo;s friends down in Carbondale. Seems there&rsquo;s a BIG stray cat problem down in that neck of the woods (presumably because of all the college students in the area, and their decision to ditch their cats when they move). I think the call she made to Amanda about the kitty went something like this:</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a bit farther in my updates for Malkier. I&rsquo;ve fixed how I&rsquo;d set up the databases. Basically I realized webmin had greater flexibility for creating databases than phpMyAdmin is currently set up to support. Things are nicely organized now in that respect. I&rsquo;ve also upgraded to the latest version of WordPress, so I&rsquo;ve gotten all those goodies and bugfixes now.
The main task left is to do some customization and update the style for my site.</p>

                <p>Part way through switching over to K2. Looks like I need to fine tune the custom page themes I&rsquo;ve previously created (for movies and header_graphics). They work at present, but the two column setup isn&rsquo;t really formatted right under the new theme.
I also want to set up a new header graphic, probably tweak the color scheme, and maybe look into some other cool options/extensions (such as embedding a flickr feed in the sidebar).</p>

                <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve gotten the critical stuff transferred over. Stuff that&rsquo;s up and running:
 DNS now points to my new server. Email has all been transferred over (hooray for IMAP!). My databases are up and running (although not set up quite how Iâ€™d like). The blog is functional (along with most of the site, since I&rsquo;m using WordPress as a basic content management system for a large portion of the site).</p>

                <p>Looks like I&rsquo;m finally going to get around to moving Malkier over to a new server.
iPowerWeb has been decent as far as hosting providers go, but they&rsquo;re clearly targetting a different market than whatever category I fall into. They provide (read: push) a bunch of web business stuff, but don&rsquo;t seem to be quite as concerned with cool webtech or security. The server I&rsquo;m on has been hit by security flaws on a few occasions, resulting in either server downtime or mass defacement of the php source throughout my site&hellip; inserted spam code in every php file on my site&hellip; Funny because it pointed to a non-existent web address and was written in such a way that every page it was on was broken and wouldn&rsquo;t even render in a browser.</p>

                <p>Caught Andrew Bird last night with Lee at the Canopy Club. Impressive live show. I was really amazed how much can come out of so few people. If you&rsquo;ve never heard Andrew Bird, his music has lots going on. Very melodic. The show (and presumably his album too) was performed by two people using slick audio equipment. They&rsquo;d play several measures on one instrument, loop it, then play along to it with other stuff.</p>

                <p>Finally got to see The Reputation live&hellip; and they rocked! Went to see them last night with Lee at Cowboy Monkey here in CU and they were fantastic. Great show. Can&rsquo;t beat the price either. $8 cover for 3 bands playing a 45 minute set each. And Lee and I were right up there by the stage. Couldn&rsquo;t get much closer without completely losing my hearing. :) A good time was definitely had by all.</p>

                <p>So recently I&rsquo;d been thinking a fair bit about how good some old DOS games were back in the day. The ones that really came to mind were the Ultima series (particularly U6: The False Prophet, U7: The Black Gate, and U7: Serpent Isle). Those were outstanding games. I&rsquo;d done a bit of research and found DOSBox, which allows you to play a wide range of old DOS games on an assortment of platforms (ie it performs x86/DOS emulation).</p>

                <p>Was just poking around online last night and realized The Reputation is playing in town again next week at the Canopy Club. And unfortunately I&rsquo;ve also realized Amanda and I are going to a Madrigal dinner at ISU in Bloomington that same night. Oh well. I&rsquo;ll get to see them some day I hope. :(</p>
