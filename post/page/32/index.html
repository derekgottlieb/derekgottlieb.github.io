                <p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy this past week, and haven&rsquo;t really had time to post. Chi-Wei checked in fixes for the bulk of the bugs I had encountered in the gui, so I&rsquo;m pretty happy. I can actually sorta use the thing now. More importantly, Jeff and I have made some comments about additional features we REALLY want, so with any luck, we&rsquo;ll actually get some of those before long.</p>

                <p>According to BJ, a glibbet is a small, weasel-like animal. Unfortunately, I have been unable to confirm this is a legit word. Most of the references I have found on the web state that it&rsquo;s a nonsense, made-up word. BJ&rsquo;s convinced it&rsquo;s legit, but I suspect it&rsquo;s just a word his favorite author made up for one of his books. I could be wrong though. I&rsquo;ll have to ask Amanda&rsquo;s mom and see if she actually confirmed this word somewhere, or if BJ just showed it to her in one of his books.</p>

                <p>So my local data caches finally started doing stuff today. Cluster 0 requests M[0x0]. The main cache sends all words in that local cache line and informs cluster 0 that it has exclusive access. Cluster 1 then requests M[0x0]. The main cache informs Cluster 0 that the block is now shared and waits for an ACK to confirm that it hasn&rsquo;t become modified. Pretty sweet! I may actually have it all up and running before much longer.</p>

                <p>Yeah, so Meijer had this great sale going on today. You could buy a GC for $99. And if that wasn&rsquo;t good enough, you got 10% off anything you purchased. So you end up actually getting a GC for $89. Hard to pass up, so I didn&rsquo;t. Got a couple of games (Animal Crossing and Mario Party 4) along with a 2nd controller so at least Amanda and I can play togeter.</p>

                <p>Grr. Looks like the storm we had last night managed to screw up my DSL service. Analog voice is fine, but I can&rsquo;t get my DSL modem to remain synched long enough to log in, let alone use it. Guess it&rsquo;s been like that since some time around 2AM (according to my system logs, that&rsquo;s when errors started showing up). Hopefully this&rsquo;ll be resolved soon or I&rsquo;m gonna be a very unhappy camper.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2003/01/31/pizza_prices/'><h1>Pizza Prices</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Yeah, so they&rsquo;ve bumped up the price of pizza at work. For as long as I&rsquo;ve been working at CRHC, we could get a slice of Papa Del&rsquo;s on Fridays for a buck. The way this works is corporations give our professors all kinds of money for being cool. One excellent example is Professor Hwu&rsquo;s IMPACT group (without which Intel wouldn&rsquo;t have made Itanium). Well, with the economy as it is, the corporate money isn&rsquo;t flowing like it used to.</p>

                <p>So, it looks like 2003 might be the year of the geek. At least as far as movies go. We&rsquo;ve got the Matrix sequels (Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions). We&rsquo;ve got the final installment of the LOTR trilogy. We&rsquo;ve got the third Harry Potter movie. And we&rsquo;ve got a slew of Marvel comic movies coming out (The Hulk, X-Men 2, Daredevil). Lookin' pretty sweet if I do say so myself.</p>

                <p>A frequent, chronological publication of personal thoughts and Web links. [Source]
Background:
A blog is often a mixture of what is happening in a person&rsquo;s life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people.
People maintained blogs long before the term was coined, but the trend gained momentum with the introduction of automated published systems, most notably Blogger at blogger.</p>
