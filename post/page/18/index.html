                <p>TV on DVD is so very cool. After a recommendation from Lee (not to mention my own curiosity), I rented the first disc of Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly a few weeks back. Really enjoyed it, so I ended up buying it. Good stuff.
Sticking with the trend, I decided to go rent the first couple of discs for BBC&rsquo;s MI-5. It had piqued my interest previously, but hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to looking for it until the recent issue of Wired reminded me.</p>

                <p>Was accosted by a guy on the quad yesterday about the strangest fundraiser I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a college campus. This guy was selling raffle tickets to win an AK-47&hellip; presumably a functional one. Didn&rsquo;t probe to see if he was raising money for some &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or if he just had it lying around and wanted more beer money. Weird!</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to hold off on buying a new PC for the foreseeable future. Have been wanting to put together a new gaming box with a semi-current graphics card so that I could play some games. My old Athlon box, polonius, is a bit long in the tooth, and my notebook, laertes, just doesn&rsquo;t quite cut it on everything. My Dell box, horatio, is fairly current (P4/2.4GHz) from the clunky video (GeForce 4 MX), but until recently I enjoyed using it exclusively as an always-on Linux box.</p>

                <p>Ack! My pants are on fire. Was just perusing the gcc website when I noticed they&rsquo;re refering to it as the GNU Compiler Collection. Hmm. Wonder if it&rsquo;s always been that way, or just since they added other languages&hellip;
Edit: Dug around their wiki some more. Looks like it used to be GNU C Compiler (at least the initial release was), just as I thought.</p>

                <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be complaining about how hot it is in winter. Truth be told, it&rsquo;s ass cold outside. But when I came into the office today it was close to 90 degrees in there! I&rsquo;ve propped the door open and tried to get in touch with Dan the friendly building manager guy any way possible. I think they&rsquo;ve tweaked something since it&rsquo;s started to come down (about 86 now), but it&rsquo;s taking a while.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/02/25/misconceptions-gcc/'><h1>Misconceptions: GCC</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Don&rsquo;t know what made me think of it this morning, but I was remembering something my first programming teacher said. He was teaching a course in introductory C programming for engineering applications and we were using gcc as our compiler. At the time, he claimed GCC stood for Good C Compiler. Seems pretty suspect since the gcc most everyone knows is actually the GNU C Compiler since it&rsquo;s been developed by the GNU organization which was founded back in 1984 (although the first release of gcc wasn&rsquo;t until 1987, but that was long before I took this course).</p>
