                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/26/ur-5beta/'><h1>UR-5beta</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>I&rsquo;ve decided to work a bit on porting over some of my old content to the new site/format. So far, I&rsquo;ve converted over the pages about the senior design project I developed with John, the UR-5beta. Figure I may put up a copy of my public key at some point, but since the only one I use with any regularity is already up at my CRHC site, I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s much point.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/21/bit-the-bullet/'><h1>Bit the Bullet</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Finally bit the bullet and ordered myself a Mac mini. There&rsquo;s a good 3-4 week lead time on them currently, so I still have time to back out if I get cold feet. But I&rsquo;ve been wanting a machine that&rsquo;d run OS X for some time now. Every so often I look into &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; used Macs on fleabay, but have always been thwarted by the remarkably high prices that old Macs go for.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/21/healthy-kitties/'><h1>Healthy Kitties!</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Took Spooky into the vet today (now that his course of antibiotics is completed), and he is a healthy little kitty. Both kitties have now had their vaccinations: Merry has had the full set of rabies and FVRCP shots, and Spooky had his first dose of the FVRCP today. I&rsquo;ll have to take him back in another month for the FVRCP booster, and then a month or two after that for rabies.</p>

                <p>It was only a matter of time. Someone got their hands on one of the new Mac minis and figured out how to open it without destroying it (Slashdot). Some fellow has the video up on his blog (wonder how long he&rsquo;ll survive the slashdot effect). I&rsquo;ve managed to snag the video already, so if he does go down, I may make it available to interested parties. A review site has also gotten their hands on a bare motherboard.</p>

                <p>So the Macworld Expo started yesterday. The big deal as I see it is the announcement of the Mac mini. That&rsquo;s actually got me kinda excited. It&rsquo;s a cute, little sub-$500 Mac that&rsquo;ll run OS X. The dimensions on this thing are quite impressive (6.5&quot; x 6.5&quot; x 2&quot;). That&rsquo;s awful tiny. Comes with a 1.25GHz G4, a 40GB ATA HDD, DVD/CD-RW, 256MB DDR RAM, 32MB Radeon 9200 DVI, and the usual plethora of I/O (10/100 ethernet, modem, audio out, Firewire, USB2).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/12/mitch-hedberg/'><h1>Mitch Hedberg</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So in my Christmas stocking this year I got a Mitch Hedberg CD, Strategic Grill Locations. I&rsquo;d seen him on Comedy Central some time back and found him absolutely hilarious. He&rsquo;s got this funny, stoner sort of vibe and just cranks out all sorts of oddball, inane comments that are really entertaining. If you are a follower of my blog, you may have already noticed that I have a number of his quotes that randomly appear in the sidebar.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/11/kitty-part-deux/'><h1>Kitty part deux</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>We adopted our second kitty this past Sunday. He is an adorable 8-week old black and white kitten. He&rsquo;s predominantly black with a little white stripe down his nose, a white chin and tummy, and white paws. As per the suggestion of his previous home (one of Amanda&rsquo;s co-workers), we&rsquo;ve decided to call him Spooky. I kept thinking of the X-Files (Fox &ldquo;Spooky&rdquo; Mulder), and he seems to spook pretty easily for a kitty as curious and fearless as he appears to be.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/12/28/christmas/'><h1>Christmas</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Had a good Christmas this year. My folks came up the Tuesday before XMas and stayed at the new house till they left this past Sunday (ie Amanda and I ran out and bought a 2nd bed the weekend before they got here). Had a pretty good visit with them and got a chance to get my Dad&rsquo;s input on some household projects.
We opened our presents to each other (Amanda, my folks, and myself) Christmas Eve&hellip; my folks and Amanda liked the panoramic photos I got from LaPayne Photography (thanks Rachel!</p>

                <p>Decided to make a new header graphic yesterday. Figured the Matrix-esque binary conflicted a bit with the title &ldquo;Pondering Dragonflies&rdquo;&hellip; especially since I&rsquo;m using the header graphic throughout the site and not just on the blog, and the site&rsquo;s named Malkier. So what better to catch the essence of something like Malkier? An old castle of course! Dug through some of my Ireland photos and came up with that pic of Blarney castle.</p>

                <p>So last weekend (not yesterday but a week before that) Amanda and I went to Bloomington to meet up with a couple of her friends from work to go see a comedy show. It was held in a dive bar (didn&rsquo;t seem all that bad by campus bar standards, but it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a ritzy comedy club either), and featured the Disgruntled Clown. He&rsquo;s the &ldquo;ex-ex-stepfather&rdquo; of one of Amanda&rsquo;s friends (we&rsquo;re not quite sure what&rsquo;s meant by the ex-ex- part&hellip; not the last ex-stepfather, but the one before that?</p>
