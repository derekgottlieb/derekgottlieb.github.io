                <p>So I&rsquo;ve seen a few of these around and been curious. Finally got around to looking into it, and it turns out Scion is a new subsidiary of Toyota. Basically, Toyota has realized that it may not have to coolest image with the youngfolk and wants to tap that market. They sorta tried with the Matrix, but I&rsquo;ve mainly seen a slightly older crowd driving them (hi dad!). Guess they figured they needed a new car company to accomplish it.</p>

                <p>Man, I&rsquo;m totally looking forward to Evil Genius for the PC. General concept reminds me of the old Dungeon Keeper series where you were an evil demon who had all sorts of minions and had to build and defend your dungeon against those darn heroes. Used to love those games.</p>

                <p>So earlier this week I noticed they had added an LED array display inside every bus. Reason I noticed this is because one of them was randomly displaying some info. Most of it was debugging stuff. What&rsquo;s the version number of this unit, how much memory does it have, what time/day is it (which was totally wrong), etc. You get the idea. Occasionally, it would scroll street intersection info across the screen (like &ldquo;PROSPECT AND KIRBY&rdquo;).</p>

                <p>So I have officially sworn off Philips. Not the screwdriver, the electronic manufacturer. I was a little confused when I pulled the dead/flaky CDRW/DVD drive out of Amanda&rsquo;s folk&rsquo;s computer last week when it turned out to be a Philips instead of some no name manufacturer. Seemed a little odd that something they made would give out in a year and a half of normal use. Turns out it may be par for the course.</p>

                <p>I think I&rsquo;ve got the bulk of the photos from our honeymoon in Ireland cleaned up and uploaded. You should be able to view them now here. I tried setting it up to auto-resize them when I uploaded (since I don&rsquo;t have the disk space to store them all full res), but I&rsquo;m not sure if I want them any bigger than it&rsquo;s currently set to. If you&rsquo;ve got any feedback in that respect, please let me know.</p>

                <p>So Amanda and I got back from our honeymoon in Ireland Monday night. We pretty much up and died when we got home. Very long day. Spent yesterday trying to get shifted back by 6 hours and deal with essential errands. We&rsquo;ve had all of Amanda&rsquo;s film developed onto CD, and I offloaded all of my digital pics to my computer. The photos are largely sorted by this point, but need some cleanup before I&rsquo;ll put them up on the web.</p>
