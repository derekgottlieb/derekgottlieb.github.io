Looks like EA has [pushed back](http://www.eagames.com/official/moh/pacificassault/us/editorial.jsp?src=special_announcement) the release of _Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault_ to some time in November.  Guess they're adding some form of squad control (basic orders like advance, fall back, suppressive fire, etc) and some general polishing.
