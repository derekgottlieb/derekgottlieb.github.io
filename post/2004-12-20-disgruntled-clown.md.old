So last weekend (not yesterday but a week before that) Amanda and I went to Bloomington to meet up with a couple of her friends from work to go see a comedy show.  It was held in a dive bar (didn't seem all that bad by campus bar standards, but it definitely wasn't a ritzy comedy club either), and featured the [Disgruntled Clown](http://www.disgruntledclown.com).  He's the "ex-ex-stepfather" of one of Amanda's friends (we're not quite sure what's meant by the ex-ex- part... not the last ex-stepfather, but the one before that?).  Anyway, it was quite an act.  We weren't quite sure what to expect, but lo and behold out steps this big guy in full clown get-up.  The show was pretty damned funny albeit a bit vulgar.  I didn't have a problem with that, but it is a little extra weird when coming from a clown.  If you ever get the chance, check out his show, but definitely leave the kids at home... and yourself if you're easily offended.  I think he mainly tours The South and the east coast, but you can check his calendar to see his upcoming dates.  Just checked and it looks like he's actually performing at someone's wedding.  Man, I hope they know what they're in for. :)
