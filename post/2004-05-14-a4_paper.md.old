So I finally have the remotest clue what the deal is with A4 paper (and as a result why the rest of the world feels the need to use it and screw up my print jobs, and make life difficult in LaTeX sometimes).  Basically, there's a [slashdot post](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/05/14/1453252.shtml?tid=137&tid=194) on it that points to [this page](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html) that discusses some of the ideas behind why A4 is the size it is.  Apparently all metric paper has a height-to-width ratio of the square root of 2.  Somehow that doesn't make me any happier when the printer at work jams because someone has tried to print a conference paper in A4 format...  Goofy metric folk.
