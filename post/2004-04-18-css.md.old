So I realized that IE and Mozilla parse CSS stuff differently.  Apparently, Mozilla will interpret everything on a line after # as a comment (at least where appropriate) whereas IE seems to interpret it normally.  As a result, my movie db looked absolutely awful in IE since I almost never use it.  Anyway, now that I know, I've taken care of it.  Should looke the same in IE and Mozilla now (at least it does for me in IE6).  As such, I also realized my blog looks different in IE and Mozilla.  Since I'm not completely happy with it in Mozilla, I guess it isn't that big a deal cause I need to work on it anyway.  

  

CSS really strikes me as being pretty slick.  I really need to look into it further and see what I can make it do.
