Yet another time of migration (blog-wise)...

### TextDrive -> Joyent -> TextDrive 2

My web hosting has been a little up in the air recently (see [Slashdot: Joyent Drops Lifetime Account Holders](http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/08/17/1734250/joyent-drops-lifetime-account-holders)).

I paid a few hundred bucks several years back (2005) for "lifetime" web hosting
at what I perceived to be a cool up and coming company (read: they claimed to
be pushing to support a lot of the flashy new web tech that wasn't well
supported by most shared web hosting providers at the time).  It was their
alternative to seeking VC money, and clearly lawyers weren't involved or they
would've left themselves an easy out. I re-upped after they merged with another
company, changed names, and made a new Lifetime upgrade offer (with similar
very clear terms on what constituded "lifetime"). Leap forward to 2012 and the
company wanted to shed this liability, leading to a big PR mess since they
handled it horribly. I'm still waiting to see how things shake out, but it
looks like they've spawned a new company (with the original company's name),
brought back the founder, and will release a revamped shared hosting product
and maintain lifetime account holders under this new company. I still worry
about whether this is a scheme to be able to kill off this new company soon and
legally nuke the "lifetime" accounts, but I'll see what comes since I have
arguably gotten my money's worth out of the hosting I've had to date.

### Linode VPS

With all of this going on, I'd been hearing good things about the VPS provider
[Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=7ae9287ffd592e3a596b4fcad4c3fc99036ae251),
and they had an anniversary celebration where they were offering effectively 6
months of free VPS hosting, so I took them up on it. Now I've got a nice Linux
VM that I manage and can do with as I please as opposed to being constrained to
the software stack a shared host provides me. I've really liked it so far, so
perhaps at some point I'll get around to doing a quick writeup on it and my
setup there.

### Wordpress -> Octopress

I honestly haven't updated my blog nearly as much since having kids, and got
tired of having to check in on it every few weeks to install all the Wordpress
security patches. Moving to a VPS meant I had to start worrying about memory
footprint and was more directly concerned about host security, so I decided it
was time to follow the current trend and go back in time with a statically
generated website. That's where I ran into [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
that looked like it was full of good stuff. I was able to migrate all the old
Wordpress content by doing an export and running a converter tool
([exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp)) and some manual cleanup for image
content and long since dead links due to previous Wordpress upgrades. Overall,
I'm pretty happy with it since it ends up being nice and portable across web
hosts, drops the need for a DB backend, and mitigates performance and security
concerns.
