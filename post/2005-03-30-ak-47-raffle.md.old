Was accosted by a guy on the quad yesterday about the strangest fundraiser I've ever seen on a college campus.  This guy was selling raffle tickets to win an AK-47... presumably a functional one.  Didn't probe to see if he was raising money for some "cause" or if he just had it lying around and wanted more beer money.  Weird!
