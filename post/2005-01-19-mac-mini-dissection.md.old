It was only a matter of time.  Someone got their hands on one of the new Mac minis and figured out how to open it without destroying it ([Slashdot](http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/05/01/19/036200.shtml?tid=174&tid=137&tid=99&tid=3)).    Some fellow has the video up on his [blog](http://www.smashsworld.com/2005/01/taking-apart-mac-mini-how-to.php) (wonder how long he'll survive the slashdot effect).  I've managed to snag the video already, so if he does go down, I may make it available to interested parties.  A review site has also gotten their hands on a [bare motherboard](http://www.mini-itx.com/news/13909018/).
