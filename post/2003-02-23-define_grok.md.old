From the novel "Stranger in a Strange Land", by Robert A. Heinlein, where it is a Martian word meaning literally "to drink" and metaphorically "to be one with". [[Source](http://www.foldoc.org/)]  
  


1. To understand, usually in a global sense.  Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge.
Contrast [zen](http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?zen), which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash.  See also [glark](http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?glark).  
  


2. Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding.  "Almost all C compilers grok the "void" type these days."
