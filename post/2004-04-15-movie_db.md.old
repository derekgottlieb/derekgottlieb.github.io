So my [movie database](/movies) continues to evolve.  I guess first I should mention what it does at this point.  Basically, I feed movie title in, my script searches for it in the [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), presents the possible matches, and then fills in all the info from IMDB (title, year, genres, director, stars, etc).  Then I can easily edit it as needed.  Tonight I added some basic caching of the main page.  In other words, if you aren't doing any sort of special query (ie list everything), it will dump the webpage to a file and simply display that if it's current, and only recreate it when the database has been updated.  Pretty cool.
