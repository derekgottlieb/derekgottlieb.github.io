Looks like the trailer for Joss Whedon's Serenity (based on the series _Firefly_) is [finally online](http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/serenity/)!  Looks pretty tight.  How am I gonna make it till September 30th when it's finally released?  Makes me want to go back and rewatch the show again.
