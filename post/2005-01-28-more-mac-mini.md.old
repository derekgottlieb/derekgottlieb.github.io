[Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/) has lots of good coverage on the [Mac mini](http://www.macworld.com/hot_topics/macmini/).  They've got a nice [review](http://www.macworld.com/2005/01/reviews/macminireview/index.php) with benchmark results, discussion of some of the available options, and even some cool findings (looks like some of the 40GB machines come with 5400rpm drives instead of 4200, and some systems may come with faster RAM, but I don't know whether it's actually being clocked any higher than PC2700).  They've got coverage on disassembly with lots of pictures ([opening](http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/01/macminiinside/index.php) it up and [stripping](http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/01/miniopen/index.php) it down to bare components).  They compare it against a ["comparable" Dell](http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/01/miniapplesandoranges/index.php), and even provide a decent [FAQ](http://www.macworld.com/2005/01/news/macminifaq/index.php).
