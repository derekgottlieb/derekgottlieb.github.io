So Richy had some nice news for me.  Turns out somebody managed to get a high quality bootleg of Monday's concert up by Tuesday afternoon.  Quality's quite good, so you may want to [check it out](http://www.pitchpipe.org/ben/).  Also, Richy's got his pictures up from the concert now.  You can see them [here](http://www.thederivative.net/gallery/benfolds).
