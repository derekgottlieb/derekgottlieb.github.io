So [slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) had an interesting IT review link today: [Juvenile _felis catus_](http://www.dansdata.com/kitten.htm) (or "kitten" for you laymen).  Full of very cute pictures, a lot of tongue-in-cheek commentary, and links to all sorts of amusing/geeky/just plain weird sites ([standard kitten package](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=handles+on+kittens) and [CAT Users' Manual](http://www.andreas.com/catman.html)).  Oh, and he even provides a convenient summary comparison against competing models (i.e. puppies, babies, or a new video card).  Now that Amanda  and I have a house, we'll get to start looking for kittens before long. :)

Edit: Pulled a certain link because I didn't want it to appear any higher on google's ranking than necessary.
