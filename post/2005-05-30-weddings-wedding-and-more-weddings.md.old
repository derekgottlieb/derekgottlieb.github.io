Been rather busy lately.  Went to my cousin's wedding 3 weekends ago in Missouri/Kansas.  Then flew down to Amanda's cousin's wedding in Texas 2 weekends ago.  My folks have been visiting this past week and just left on Sunday morning.  To top that off, I've had some sort of nasty sinus infection for the past week.  Next weekend we're off to Iowa for Amanda's coworker's wedding and on the way back I'll be going to [ISCA '05](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~isca2005/) in Wisconsin for a few days.
