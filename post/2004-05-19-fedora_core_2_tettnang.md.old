So I was kinda curious what the story was behind the name for FC2 (Tettnang).  Honestly, I was a little curious about FC1 (Yarrow), but never looked into it.  Historically, Redhat has largely stuck with a naming convention where each release name relates to the immediate predecessor in some way, but not that predecessor's predecessor (grandparent?).  Anyway, [this page](http://fedora.redhat.com/about/history/) at the Fedora site seems to cover it to some extent, and [here's](http://www.owlriver.com/redhat_versions.html) a little more discussion on what some of those release names mean (and how they relate) (even more [here](http://www.owlriver.com/RH-true-names.html)).  

  

Anyway, check out the [Wikipedia's](http://en.wikipedia.org/) entry for [Tettnang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettnang).  Guess the Fedora bunch are beer fans.
