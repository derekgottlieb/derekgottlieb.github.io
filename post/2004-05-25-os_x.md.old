Looks like you actually can [emulate a PPC](http://pearpc.sourceforge.net) on an x86 well enough to install OS X.  It's still a little on the slow side (basic emulation results in 500:1 slowdown over the host processor, while their JIT compiler for x86 brings that up to more like 40:1 slowdown since they cache the translated code), but the project seems pretty active, and there's lots of room for improvement.  Still pretty need to see Mac OS X running on a PC (either Windows or Linux, but I've just tried Linux at this point).  Here's a few screenshots that show it off:
