Yay!  My Digital Rebel just got here!!

![](/old-wp-images/digital_rebel.jpg)

To recap, I finally decided to break down and get myself something fun for getting my thesis deposited.  Decided last week that I'd get myself a [Canon Digital Rebel EOS-300D](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=9430) if I could find it at a price I liked.  Ended up getting it at a pretty decent price ($200-250 off what I could get it for locally).  Looks like it should be a pretty sweet camera ([Review, [Another](http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/canon/eos_300d-review/index.shtml)).  Comes with an 18 - 55 mm EF-S lens (F3.5 - F5.6) and a battery that should be worth several hundred shots before a recharge.

I'd also been considering the [Nikon D70](http://nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&grp=2&productNr=25214), but it sounds like I'd get shots I was happier with out of the Canon with less tweaking on my part.  I think the D70's a little more powerful and flexible, but it also would appear to run me another $500 (was having trouble finding any respectable shops that discount them), and being the newbie that I am, I doubt I'd get that much more out of it.  Since I don't have an existing lens collection for either manufacturer, it ended up being a toss up, so I went with the cheaper option.

Now I just have to figure out how to make good use of it (and pick up a UV filter, carrying case, etc).  Presumably at some point I'll get some additional lenses (telephoto and macro being the most likely).](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos300d/)
