So [Elysium](http://malaise.no-ip.com/~dgottlie/specs/elysium.html) seems to be having more trouble these days.  Some games are pretty choppy, just plain refuse to load, etc.  Can't quite decide whether it's a hardware or software issue.  I mean, it's been a while since I last wiped so that's a possibility.  Also seems there might be some issues with the drivers MS included with XP for my network card.  Then there's the quirks associated with my memory (populating all 3 DIMM slots may not be a Good ThingÂ™), and my so-called RAID card (random reboots when the drives get heavily accessed).  Who knows.  There's probably just too much crap in there.
