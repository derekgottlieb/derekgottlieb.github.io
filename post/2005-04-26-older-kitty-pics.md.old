Finally got around to loading up some of my older kitty pics that were on my other camera.  They [start off](http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/52744337/in/set-1144844/) with Spooky attacking Space Chicken when he was a little bitty kitten, and moves on to the [cats playing with each other and a box](http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/52745356/in/set-1144844/).

Unfortunately, when I went to download them onto my computer I accidently deleted them instead of downloading them (bit of a usability issue with [Picasa](http://picasa.com/) IMHO).  Guess I'll have to go take some more tomorrow.
