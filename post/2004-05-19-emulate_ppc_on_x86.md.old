I must be in one heck of a blogging mood today.  I saw [this Slashdot post](http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/04/05/18/2159257.shtml?tid=107&tid=185&tid=187&tid=190) and thought it sounded pretty sweet.  Turns out, they've released a GPL'd PPC emulator for x86 that is actually capable of booting OS X.  Here's the [OS-News article](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7085) that includes all the pretty pictures.  Sounds like it's still got a few problems (reviewer ran into a few infinite loop explosions once OS X had started, and it guzzles the whole CPU), but it actually kinda worked.  Guess there's still hope for me playing with OS X without spending money on an actual Mac.  Keep figuring someone some day will release something as nice as VMware that emulates a PPC Mac instead of a x86 PC...  All the OS X converts I see around my department and over in CS have my interest piqued.
