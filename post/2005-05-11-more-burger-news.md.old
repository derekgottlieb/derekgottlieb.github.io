Ok, it's not exactly news.  But I've randomly run into some more food oddities.  I say randomly because I ran across it on [this guy's](http://weblog.scifihifi.com/) [del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/ldandersen) (he wrote [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/), a slick [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) client for OS X).  Anyway, here's [the link](http://texasburgerguy.blogspot.com/2005/05/luther-burger-and-hamdog-pictures.html).  Featured are the Luther Burger (a bacon cheeseburger served on a toasted Krispy Kreme bun) and the Hamdog (a hot dog wrapped in a beef patty that's deep fried, covered with chili, cheese and onions, and served on a hoagie bun topped with a fried egg and two fistfuls of fries).  Reminds me a bit of the garbage plate at Nick Tahoe's in Rochester!  Although somehow more disturbing.
