So the pages feature looks like it'll be pretty slick.  I've managed to set up the main frontpage for the site so that it loads up the page I created inside of WP.  I'm not sure it's the most efficient way to do it, but it does work.  Definitely looks like WP is well on it's way to being a fairly complete CMS (content management system).  Will have to see if I can differentiate between blog pages and normal content pages so that I can have a reduced sidebar for all things not blog.
