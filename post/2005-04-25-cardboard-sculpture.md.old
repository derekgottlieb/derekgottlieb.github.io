So there's this art class on campus that does fairly large sculptures out of cardboard.  At the end of the semester, the students showcase their work out on the quad and apparently other places on campus.  Saw the coolest (read: geekiest) one today in the main atrium/lobby in Beckman... a 10 foot tall Optimus Prime!!!  That thing rules!  I'm gonna have to try to remember to bring a camera with me tomorrow to document it. :)  Wish the course had a website documenting student projects.  There have been all sorts of cool ones in the past, like giant spiders.
