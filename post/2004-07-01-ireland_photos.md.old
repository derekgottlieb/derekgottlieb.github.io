I think I've got the bulk of the photos from our honeymoon in Ireland cleaned up and uploaded.  You should be able to view them now [here](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/1149424/).  I tried setting it up to auto-resize them when I uploaded (since I don't have the disk space to store them all full res), but I'm not sure if I want them any bigger than it's currently set to.  If you've got any feedback in that respect, please let me know.
