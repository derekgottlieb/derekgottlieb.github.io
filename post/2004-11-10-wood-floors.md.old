Mmmm.  Wood floors.  Got solid oak installed downstairs over the past couple of days.  Really looks outstanding.  I've got a bunch of pics up at the [usual place](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/1142478/), but they simply don't do it justice.  If you have a chance to come see, do so! :)  Got an estimate for putting ceramic tile in the kitchen and bathrooms, and replacing the rest of the carpet (stairs and upstairs hall/bedrooms) with new carpet.  Scheduled to go in after all of this ISCA hubbub is over with.
