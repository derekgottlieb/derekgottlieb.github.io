So I borrowed some movies from [Richy](http://thederivative.net/) this past weekend (namely Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Batman, and Batman Returns).  It reminded me just how good Jurassic Park was.  Heck, I even used a quote from it in my high school yearbook (you ever look back at that sort of stuff and wonder what you were thinking... all sorts of really meaningful/significant quotes you can put in there, and I put in something from a fairly silly hollywood flick).  Anyways, this got me to thinking about how I've been drawn to movies in the past.  They frequently seem to end up as the focus for papers I've written for classes (including Jurassic Park, Top Gun, Heavenly Creatures, Reservoir Dogs, and of course a host of films I watched in film studies classes as an undergrad).  Now that I think about it, there were probably times when I wrote papers on a movie back in high school and before that were technically supposed to be about the book it was based on.  But really, who wouldn't rather watch a dull movie than a dull book?
