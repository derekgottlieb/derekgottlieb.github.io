Saw [this Slashdot post](http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/05/04/28/1351224.shtml?tid=123&tid=187).  A student at CMU made a [website](http://www.walmart-foundation.org/) parodying the [Wal-Mart Foundation](http://www.walmartfoundation.org/) (a thinly veiled attempt to improve the parent corp's public image through small scattered donations) for a class on "Parasitic Media".  Guess Wal-Mart didn't take too kindly to how they were portrayed, so they whipped out that horrendous piece of legeslation, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA).  The DMCA's a vague wording allows large corporations with lots of cash to easily threaten things they don't like.  Sounds a bit like  the RIAA going after Diamond Multimedia when they first released the RIO portable MP3 player (first MP3 player backed by a major corporation).  I wrote a brief bit about it back when I was an undergrad taking a course on ethics in engineering (surprisingly enough, it's still available [here on the course website](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/courses/ECE399/GOTTLIEB/index.html)).

Wonder if the Feds will go after [mypyramid.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20050605005418/http://www.mypyramid.org/) (a spoof Jeff pointed out yesterday parodying the FDA's revamp of the food pyramid at [mypyramid.gov](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420032521/http://www.mypyramid.gov/)).

**2015-02-15:** I updated the links for mypyramid.org and myrpyramid.gov to point to archive.org snapshots dating back to 2005 since the sites no longer exist. Also see [this post](/blog/2015/02/15/odd-request-from-someone-at-the-public-health-foundation/) detailing why I would update a 10 year old blog post.
