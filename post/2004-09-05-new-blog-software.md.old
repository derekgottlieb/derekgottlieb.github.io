So I've decided to upgrade my blog software from [b2](http://cafelog.com/) to what it evolved into, [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).  For the moment, the old setup will continue to reside [here](http://malkier.com/b2), while the new version will reside [here](http://malkier.com).  This will be the last post to the old setup, to point people over to the new one.  I figured while I was at it, I would revamp the style once again, since I was never 100% happy with the old one.  I've decided to start with the [Kubrick style](http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick), and see where it takes me.
