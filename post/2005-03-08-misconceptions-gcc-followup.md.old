Ack!  My pants are on fire.  Was just perusing the [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/) website when I noticed they're refering to it as the GNU Compiler Collection.  Hmm.  Wonder if it's always been that way, or just since they added other languages...

Edit: Dug around their [wiki](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/) some more.  Looks like it used to be GNU C Compiler (at least the initial release was), just as I thought.
