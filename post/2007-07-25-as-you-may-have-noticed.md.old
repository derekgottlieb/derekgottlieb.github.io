Amanda and I are [buying a new house](http://flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/72157600884081816/).  In a land far far from CU... Huntsville, AL to be exact... or technically Madison, AL to be even more exact (suburb to the west of Huntsville).

No, Derek didn't graduate.  While one could ask "why is he leaving sans-degree", a better question might be "why is he referring to himself in the third person?"  To put it simply, I just got fed up with how things have been going (or not going to be more precise) and decided it was time for a change.  And what could be a bigger change for me than to get an actual job-type job and leave academia behind.  I ended up taking a job at the [Alabama Supercomputer Authority](http://www.asc.edu/) in Huntsville, which sounds like it should be a great place to work.
