Don't know what made me think of it this morning, but I was remembering something my first programming teacher said.  He was teaching a course in introductory C programming for engineering applications and we were using gcc as our compiler.  At the time, he claimed GCC stood for Good C Compiler.  Seems pretty suspect since the gcc most everyone knows is actually the GNU C Compiler since it's been developed by the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) organization which was founded back in 1984 (although the first release of gcc wasn't until 1987, but that was long before I took this course).  So either my memory is faulty, or that guy was a dumbass.  Hard to tell which is the case since both are likely. :)
