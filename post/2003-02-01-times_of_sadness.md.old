Grr.  Looks like the storm we had last night managed to screw up my DSL service.  Analog voice is fine, but I can't get my DSL modem to remain synched long enough to log in, let alone use it.  Guess it's been like that since some time around 2AM (according to my system logs, that's when errors started showing up).  Hopefully this'll be resolved soon or I'm gonna be a very unhappy camper.  
  


On a lighter note, Animal Crossing is really cute.  Amanda and I keep getting new neighbors all the time, and we've donated all sorts of fish and fossils to the museum.  I have yet to put my finger on what I enjoy about the game, but I do know it's fun _(and addictive)_.
