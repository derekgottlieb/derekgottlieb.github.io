Ok.  Ran across this weird site this morning when I was perusing [suprnova](http://suprnova.org).  The link is [howtodogirls.com](http://www.howtodogirls.com/index.php).  Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Some sort of perverse instructional site.  Well, you'd be right, but it's probably not exactly what you've got in mind.  Apparently, they've got a few bikini models who will do a variety of instructional videos (the episode that's currently available is titled "Intro to Bikini Calculus").  So it's really more of a bunch of girls doing "how-to (do)" videos instead of "how-to-do-girls" videos...  Weird.
