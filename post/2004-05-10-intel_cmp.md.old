Well, it looks like Intel is finally going CMP (@ [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/05/07/intel_cancels_tejas/) and [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&storyID=5078083)).  They're apparently going to address some of the issues associated with continuing to push for high performance with big monolithic superscalars (namely: power consumption associated with crazy-high clock frequencies, scaling limitations of centralized hardware structures, and the benefits of supporting higher throughput through parallelism instead of only relying on low-latency for sequential code).  Pretty exciting if you're a geek like me... and would love a multiprocessor system. :)
