Got a couple of song lyrics related websites for you.  I rarely have a clue what the artist/author means when they create something, be it abstract painting, poetry, or song lyrics.  So I found [songmeanings.net](http://songmeanings.net/) of some interest.  On a related note, have you ever heard little kids singing a song (or the pledge of allegience).  As a group, they usually sound about right, but if you listen to them individually, you hear some rather bizarre stuff that sounds about right, but is totally wrong.  Well, [kissthisguy.com](http://www.kissthisguy.com/) is full of stuff like that.  The domain name comes from Hendrix's "Purple Haze" ("Scuse me, while I kiss this guy..." vs. "kiss the sky").  According to the site, Hendrix was even aware of this common mishearance (?), and would play it up sometimes live.
