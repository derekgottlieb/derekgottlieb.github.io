... to the bikini.  Or at least that's what I saw on the news this morning.  Guess it must have been a slow news day with all the terror threats about flights from the UK heading to the US and all.  Or maybe that was just one of those silly morning shows I caught and not really the news...

The bikini's been around for 60 years, although I guess it really made it's debut back in Paris on July 5, 1946 and was invented in May of that year.  Interesting factoid, it was apparently named after the Bikini Atoll which was a nuclear bomb test site.Â  After all, what do men like more than bare skin on the ladies and big explosions.
