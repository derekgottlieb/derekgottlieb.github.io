Decided to make a new header graphic yesterday.  Figured the Matrix-esque binary conflicted a bit with the title "Pondering Dragonflies"... especially since I'm using the header graphic throughout the site and not just on the blog, and the site's named Malkier.  So what better to catch the essence of something like Malkier?  An old castle of course!  Dug through some of my Ireland photos and came up with that pic of Blarney castle.  I'm not 100% happy with the graphic as it currently stands.  Had to rework some stuff to make space for the title, and I'm not totally happy with that.  Also, the link text that appears at the bottom is not entirely readable at present.

Oh, and I've finally decided to maintain a history of previous [header graphics](http://malkier.com/header_graphics.php) that I've used.
