So [Nick](http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/~npcarter/) scheduled our first Amalgam meeting of the semester for today.  But unfortunately, our meetings are scheduled for right before his class (which he has never taught before).  As a result, he ditched our meeting to finish preparing his lecture.  Nothing like getting things done early.  Anyway, he dropped by around 1/2 hour before the meeting to tell Jeff and me that he wasn't coming and we should figure out where the project will be around the end of the semester and what conferences we should shoot for.  Fun fun.  At least there isn't an obvious conference for my work till June, so I should actually have enough time to do some real work and have a decent shot at having publishable work by then.
