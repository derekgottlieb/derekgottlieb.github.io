Looks like their calendar solution has gone "live".  Looks like it has most of the stuff I'd like...  add events via web, multiple calendars, publish all info or free/busy info (or nothing), subscribing to other published calendars (such as the [UIUC Academic calendar](webcal://www.acm.uiuc.edu/iCal/UIUC_Academic_Calendar.ics) courtesy of ACM's Macwarriors), import CSV/iCal, export XML/iCal, assorted notification options, some sort of ability to auto-add event invites, manage who you share a given calendar with (including giving them the ability to manage events).

You can check it out at [http://www.google.com/calendar/](http://www.google.com/calendar/).

...and if you hadn't guessed, I'm having trouble falling asleep...
