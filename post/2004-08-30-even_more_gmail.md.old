I haven't had much luck getting the GNOME GTray app to work under Fedora.  Dug around a little bit, and came up with a [Firefox extension](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/doron/archives/005836.html) that largely does the trick (although you should probably just go to [the front page](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/doron/) and look for the newest version).  Now I have to check my browser window to see if I've got new Gmail as opposed to simply looking at the GNOME system tray, but at least it works.
