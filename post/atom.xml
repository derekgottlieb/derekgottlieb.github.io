      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-tinkering&#34;&gt;Technical tinkering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-im-reading&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Well of Ascension&amp;rdquo;, Brandon Sanderson (audiobook). Book 2 of the Mistborn Saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sleeping Giants&amp;rdquo;, Sylvain Neuvel (audiobook). SciFi that centers around discovering pieces of a giant robot told
via a series of interviews. Works well as a full cast audiobook, similar in structure to Max Brooks&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;World War Z&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;Devolution&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll be seeking out the later books in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The End of the World: Stories of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, multiple authors. Mixed bag, which I guess is to be expected for
an anthology like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Sentinel&amp;rdquo;, Lee Child and Andrew Child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Winterborne Home for Mayhem and Mystery&amp;rdquo;, Ally Carter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Hero of Ages&amp;rdquo;, Brandon Sanderson (audiobook).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Digger Unearthed: The Complete Tenth Anniversary Collection&amp;rdquo;, Ursula Vernon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mapping the Interior&amp;rdquo;, Stephen Graham Jones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly working my way
through &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
by Herbert Wolverson. I generally reach for Ruby first when there&amp;rsquo;s something I want to build, but having familiarity
with other languages has a number of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-im-reading&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zombie Bake-Off&amp;rdquo;, Stephen Graham Jones (audiobook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files&amp;rdquo;, Jim Butcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The End of the World: Stories of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, multiple authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Winterborne Home for Mayhem and Mystery&amp;rdquo;, Ally Carter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Panic: Douglas Adams &amp;amp; the Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guid to the Galaxy&amp;rdquo;, Neil Gaiman (audiobook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Siren Queen&amp;rdquo;, Nghi Vo (audiobook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor&amp;rdquo;, Ally Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files&amp;rdquo;, Jim Butcher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-im-playing&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m playing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completed - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wadjeteyegames.com/games/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow/&#34;&gt;The Excavation of Hob&amp;rsquo;s Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.
Point-and-click adventure with a folk horror theme, retro visual style, and good voice acting / sound design that
combines to achieve an effective sense of dread. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Control scheme worked well on Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completed - &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange_2&#34;&gt;Life is Strange 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/351940/The_Descendant/&#34;&gt;The Descendant&lt;/a&gt;. Had several crashes early in the game on
Steam Deck. May have to come back to this one when I can play it on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-im-reading&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ghost Story&amp;rdquo;, Peter Straub (audiobook). I was hopeful after having enjoyed his collaborations with Stephen King
(&amp;ldquo;The Talisman&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Black House&amp;rdquo;). While I enjoyed some of the prose, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would&amp;rsquo;ve made it through if I
were reading it instead of listening while doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emilyrcwilson.com/the-odyssey&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Odyssey&amp;rdquo;, Homer / Emily Wilson - translator&lt;/a&gt; (audiobook). Fairly
approachable modern translation written in iambic pentameter verse and narrated by Claire Danes. Includes a lengthy
introduction and translator&amp;rsquo;s note that provides additional context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The End of the World: Stories of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, multiple authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files&amp;rdquo;, Jim Butcher.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>My Reading Trends and 2019 Highlights</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2022/12/01/my-reading-trends-and-2019-highlights/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 20:48:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2022/12/01/my-reading-trends-and-2019-highlights/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2019, I decided to make a more committed effort to reading in my free time, I think
somewhat prompted by Goodreads&amp;rsquo; annual reading challenge feature combined with the added
convenience of reading on a Kindle. I read ~30 books that year, with a mix of books I read for
myself and ones I read aloud to the kids as part of our long-standing nightly bedtime routine.
With a shift to working from home during 2020 and increased work schedule flexibility, that
ramped up to ~100 books in 2020 and ~150 in 2021. This year I discovered audiobooks and started
listening to them during times I would have listened to podcasts previously, which meant even
more time for books (over 250 so far this year). I&amp;rsquo;m not usually one to write a review or even
rate books as I read them, but have been thinking it would be nice to better capture some that
I&amp;rsquo;ve either particularly enjoyed or have made a strong impression on me. With that in mind,
here are my highlights from 2019 (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Neverwhere&amp;rdquo; by Neil Gaiman: Absolutely lovely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impossible Times series by Mark Lawrence (&amp;ldquo;One Word Kill&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Limited Wish&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Dispel Illusion&amp;rdquo;): Fun Time Travel? Sign me up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kingkiller Chronicle series by Patrick Rothfuss (&amp;ldquo;The Name of the Wind&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Wise Man&amp;rsquo;s Fear&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;The Slow Regard of Silent Things&amp;rdquo;): I felt the early part of the 1st book dragged a bit for me, but once it picked up I loved this series. Really hopeful it continues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sixth World series by Rebecca Roanhorse (&amp;ldquo;Trail of Lightning&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Storm of Locusts&amp;rdquo;): Post apocalyptic setting, urban fantasy, and Diné mythology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skyward series by Brandon Sanderson (&amp;ldquo;Skyward&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Starsight&amp;rdquo;): Enjoyable YA sci-fi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dragon Pearl&amp;rdquo; by Yoon Ha Lee: Another YA sci-fi, elements of Korean (?) mythology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Rising saga by Pierce Brown (&amp;ldquo;Red Rising&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Golden Son&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Morning Star&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Iron Gold&amp;rdquo;): Violent dystopian sci-fi. Strong Hunger Games vibe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I finally finished the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson (&amp;ldquo;Towers of Midnight&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;A Memory of Light&amp;rdquo;): I found some of the books struggled with pacing, which put me off for a while. Glad I saw it through to the end. I&amp;rsquo;ve happily gone back and re-read or listened to some of the early books in the series more than once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Synology DSM7 SPK for Nomad</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2021/11/24/synology-dsm7-spk-for-nomad/</link>

      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2021/11/24/synology-dsm7-spk-for-nomad/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been interested in experimenting with Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Nomad for deploying/running apps as an alternative to the the somewhat convoluted combination of Docker + ansible I currently use. Since I primarily use a Synology NAS for running Dockerized apps, my first hurdle was coming up with a way to somewhat sanely install the nomad server/client on a Synology. I found nomad-spk that was promising, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with the latest major version of the Synology OS (aka DSM7).</description>

      <title>3D Print: Extra Car Cup Holders</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2020/11/06/3d-print-extra-car-cup-holders/</link>

&lt;p&gt;My car only has two cup holders up front, which is annoying if you have a
family of four and hit a drive-thru. So I designed and printed two more that
fit in a somewhat useless storage cubby in the center console.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3D Print: USB Stylus Holder</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2020/11/03/3d-print-usb-stylus-holder/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we got Chromebooks for our girls so they could more easily
do their virtual schoolwork. iPads proved to be frustrating for some things, so
we opted for Chromebooks since we knew that would be similar to what they&amp;rsquo;d use
at school. We also got them each a stylus that was compatible with the
Chromebooks (specifically one meeting the USI standard). I wanted a way for
them to be able to keep them with their computers in the hope that if I had an
easy way for them to keep track of it, they&amp;rsquo;d be less likely to lose them.
Nothing quite matched my needs. I&amp;rsquo;d initially tried to print an existing design
that plugged into an empty USB port, but it was designed for a stylus with
different dimensions and would not work for ours. Inspired by that general
design, I put together the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50562872208_5722aa039b_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;USB stylus holder&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling with modern modeling software, but it came together after
a few design iterations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been impressed by its capabilities and the wealth of readily available models shared by the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Finally got around to migrating the blog from Jekyll/Octopress to Hugo. I managed to preserve the RSS feed URL, so it was a fairly smooth migration aside from a blip when feed readers thought all the posts were new again it. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got some work tweaking the theme and category/tag pages, but seems to be working out pretty well.</description>

      <description>I recently received a question about SGI&amp;rsquo;s pandora after someone found my run-pandora.sh script in my hpc-admin-scripts repo. They were looking for a way to test a server with a fair bit of memory in a short amount of time. They&amp;rsquo;d tried Memtest86 and found it to be incredibly slow when running single-threaded or proved too unstable when running on all cores. When they found my repo, they figured it&amp;rsquo;d be worth asking about pandora in the hopes it would be appropriate for their needs.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking that I should write down some of my views on IT. I
don&amp;rsquo;t believe in a black &amp;amp; white world, but in one that&amp;rsquo;s full of realities,
tradeoffs, and compromises. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with people who refuse to (or are
unable to) recognize that and spend energy trying to dictate instead of
collaborate, typically to the detriment of themselves and frustration of
everyone around them. IT exists to support and enable an organization, and
should not be an end unto itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I&amp;rsquo;d migrated from Wordpress to a static site generator for my blog as part of migrating off a shared web host to a VPS. I&amp;rsquo;d started with Octopress since it had been getting a fair bit of buzz at the time. I was pretty happy with the rendered output, but the underlying software had its flaws. The author (Brandon Mathis) highlighted some of those flaws in his post on the road to Octopress 3.</description>

      <description>As part of developing RESTful HTTP APIs at work, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of discussion over the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; way to architect/implement everything. To avoid relying strictly on my own instincts and relearning mistakes that many others have already learned from, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Building Microservices. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it yet, but have gotten a lot out of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far (and been pleased to see that my instincts have been largely supported by someone who&amp;rsquo;s experienced implementing such systems).</description>

      <title>Odd request from someone at the Public Health Foundation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phf.org/&#34;&gt;Public Health Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
contacted me because they found a blog post I had from back in 2005,
specifically &lt;a href=&#34;https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/04/28/corporategovernment-parodies-on-the-web/&#34;&gt;Corporate/Government Parodies on the
Web&lt;/a&gt;. They asked if
I&amp;rsquo;d like to update the broken reference to mypyramid.gov (which no longer
exists) in favor of a new government nutrition website. Having gone back and
re-read the post for context, I initially thought I&amp;rsquo;d just ignore it for the
moment since I figured it had to be some automated webcrawler of sending emails
to DNS contacts for any hits referencing the old .gov URL. But they actually
sent me a followup email, so I thought I might go ahead and make some updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been busy week, but I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve at least got something to show for it.
The first big project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on has gone public at ITEXPO East 2015 and I
can actually talk about it now. The new service is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digium.com/rescue&#34;&gt;Switchvox Rescue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2015/01/25/new-job-adventures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About six months ago, I took a new job and left the position I&amp;rsquo;d held at the
Alabama Supercomputer Center for roughly seven years. I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled whether I
should write a post about why I chose to leave my old job or focus on the
positive and talk about my new job. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/fedbiz_daily/2014/04/morale-problems-at-csc-employees-sound-off.html?full=true&#34;&gt;this article at the

      <title>VPS provider hopping</title>

      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2015/01/24/vps-provider-hopping/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a while back I started looking at alternative VPS hosting providers. I was
impressed by the service Linode provided, but started wondering if I&amp;rsquo;d get
better bang for my buck going elsewhere. At the time, I was paying $20 / month
for their smallest Xen VPS or $25 / month if I wanted their backup service. My
hosting needs were modest, especially since I&amp;rsquo;d migrated just about everything
from dynamic stuff with a DB backend to primarily serving static content. So I
could really get away with something with leaner. I shied away from the
extremely cheap OpenVZ providers, and tried a couple of different KVM VPS
providers before I found one that offered a balance of cost, reliability, and
performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Btrfs production experiences</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2013/04/29/btrfs-production-experiences/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2013/04/29/btrfs-production-experiences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My experience is based on SUSE SLES 11 SP1/SP2 with a stock kernel, so YMMV if
you&amp;rsquo;re running a newer mainline kernel without all the backports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested on two Supermicro systems. One with an LSI HBA card with 22x 2TB
enterprise SATA drives (originally purchased to run OpenSolaris/ZFS). Second
has an Adaptec hardware RAID controller with 36x 2TB enterprise SATA drives.
Some of the data loss and stability issues I experienced may be attributed to
later discovering the &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; drives used in the first system turned out
to be less RAID-friendly than the manufacturer claimed, eventually leading to
them to replace ALL of my drives with a different model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btrfs was a preview in SLES SP1 and is &amp;ldquo;supported&amp;rdquo; in SP2 but with major
restrictions if you wanted a supported configuration. Support in SP2 requires
that you create btrfs filesystems using Yast and live with the limited options
it allows.  I&amp;rsquo;m guessing what you can do via Yast is the subset of features
they tested enough to be willing to try and support.  I tried using Yast to set
up btrfs on one of our systems, but found their constraints too limiting given
my use case and the organization I&amp;rsquo;d settled on in the SP1 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Locking your Mac based on iPhone proximity</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2012/11/21/locking-your-mac-based-on-iphone-proximity/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2012/11/21/locking-your-mac-based-on-iphone-proximity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; I should note I only partially sorted out getting this to actually
work.  Probably requires more tinkering and may be best to just go get an app
that does the lock/unlock for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure is roughly based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://bazscott.com/blog/2012/10/09/lock-your-mac-when-your-iphone-is-out-of-range/&#34;&gt;Lock Your Mac When Your iPhone Is Out of
Range&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;d seen this in the past, but never got around to figuring out how to set it
up.  Since I&amp;rsquo;ve got an iPhone with good battery life, leaving Bluetooth on
isn&amp;rsquo;t as scary as it was on my old Android phone, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a
shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone the extra steps of figuring out how to retrieve your password from
Keychain in order to do the unlock.  The sample unlock AppleScript in that post
suggests storing your Mac account password in plain text in the script (not so
great) and offers that you can save your script as &amp;ldquo;Run-only&amp;rdquo; to obfuscate it.
I tried that for kicks and while the script itself is obfuscated, your plain
text password is still there if you just cat the file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

TextDrive -&amp;gt; Joyent -&amp;gt; TextDrive 2 My web hosting has been a little up in the air recently (see Slashdot: Joyent Drops Lifetime Account Holders).
I paid a few hundred bucks several years back (2005) for &amp;ldquo;lifetime&amp;rdquo; web hosting at what I perceived to be a cool up and coming company (read: they claimed to be pushing to support a lot of the flashy new web tech that wasn&amp;rsquo;t well supported by most shared web hosting providers at the time).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My foray into the world of Android phones is finally at an end, and am now the
owner of a shiny iPhone 4S.  It was an interesting experiment, and there were a
few features that I will miss that I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a way to do on the iPhone,
but the Android experience finally got bad enough (and I hit my 2 year contract
anniversary) to push for a phone upgrade at work.  There were just too many
issues with my Droid and Android in general from a usability standpoint to
suffer it any further.  Issues with the Android ecosystem (at least as I&amp;rsquo;ve
been able to experience it&amp;hellip; maybe 4.0 will really start to address some of
their problems):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for a long time, but I&amp;rsquo;m finally doing it.  When I
first got into having a website, I&amp;rsquo;d registered my domain name with GoDaddy
based on some recommendations at the time.  Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of
reasons to move away from them, but never quite got around to it.  But their
support for SOPA has finally pushed me to transfer my domains elsewhere.  For
now, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved most of my domains over to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.namecheap.com&#34;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt; and the ones I couldn&amp;rsquo;t over to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://name.com&#34;&gt;Name.com&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure GoDaddy doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give a rip that
I&amp;rsquo;m leaving (since I only had a few domains with them), but their support of
SOPA has prompted others to move 100s of domains elsewhere and some big clients
to threaten to move 100s to 1000s more if they don&amp;rsquo;t change their stance on
this lousy piece of proposed legislation (e.g., see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/&#34;&gt;this Reddit

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this upcoming week is the big annual supercomputing convention,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://sc10.supercomputing.org&#34;&gt;SC10&lt;/a&gt;, down in New Orleans.  Since I&amp;rsquo;m
skipping out (anxiously waiting for the arrival of Little Miss Sunshine), I&amp;rsquo;ve
got time to actually try and read through the slew of new product announcements
and news coverage.  So today I saw this quote on twitter from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/hpc_guru&#34;&gt;hpc_guru&lt;/a&gt; and just had to share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cost of the building next generation of supercomputers is not the problem. The cost of running the machines is what concerns engineers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last November, I finally got a smartphone (through work no less).  Gotta
love not having to pay that monthly phone+data bill.  The iPhone always had a
lot of appeal to me, but the thought of having to switch to AT&amp;amp;T wasn&amp;rsquo;t
especially attractive to me.  I&amp;rsquo;m not big on the restrictions Verizon usually
places on their phones (let&amp;rsquo;s disable all the features of your phone out so we
can force you to use an expensive VZW service instead and nickle-and-dime you
to death).  But it&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat their coverage.  Long story short (too late),
I ended up with a Motorola Droid running Google&amp;rsquo;s Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what I thought initially when Lee clued me into it (indie music being a new thing for me), but after that first month I was hooked. Took me a few months and then I bumped up to the annual subscription option. Until recently, my most recent subscription plan worked out to $16/month, which got me 90 tracks a month.</description>

      <description>Well this is certainly not something I expected. SGI is one of the few HPC vendors out there that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of who are still doing neat things with hardware. We&amp;rsquo;ve got some of their large SMP Itanium boxes on the floor where I work, and I think they&amp;rsquo;re pretty slick machines. Pricy, but slick. And so far their support is about the best I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with. That&amp;rsquo;s not saying their perfect (try getting a CXFS guru on the phone when you need one without sitting on a major outage for several hours), but they generally seem better than most of the other HPC vendors I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with (IBM, Cray).</description>

      <description>So this story has been all over the place (at least if you read computing/HPC news). Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer and designer of the historically significant Apple I and Apple II, took a job as chief scientist at a startup I was already aware of, Fusion-io. They&amp;rsquo;ve been designing PCIe boards loaded with flash memory to deliver super high performance storage to servers and maybe high-end gamers. In theory it&amp;rsquo;s using similar technology to SSDs, but they&amp;rsquo;re able to achieve significantly higher bandwidth and IOPs than has been achieved in an SSD that is focused on stuffing flash into a conventional SATA hard drive form factor.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, we went up to Nashville and hit a number of the sights. I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and split this into two posts, since I&amp;rsquo;ve only uploaded some of the relevant photos so far. The first day, we hit their recreation of the Parthenon. Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s actually the second replica they&amp;rsquo;ve built, with the first being built in 1897 to celebrate their centennial but it was only built to last 6 months.</description>

      <description>My masters have hauled me down to this strange new land they keep referring to as The South. It seems like I&amp;rsquo;ve been hear for ages, which is apparently just long enough for them to inflict me with a bladder infection. I felt so uncomfortable I showed them who&amp;rsquo;s boss by peeing in things to anger them, and figured they&amp;rsquo;d break them any moment. Since they hadn&amp;rsquo;t made me better, I figured I had to be more blunt with these simpletons and started going to the litter box every fifteen minutes and I even stooped so low as to drag my ass on the carpet like a filthy dog.</description>

      <description>Medical researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) have discovered a new use for scorpion venom &amp;ndash; cancer medication. Each year, some 9,000 Americans are diagnosed with malignant glioma, a form of brain cancer that kills about half its victims within a year of diagnosis.
Glioma cells work a lot like cockroach muscle cells. And while that fact is pretty disgusting, it also got UAB researchers thinking about the giant Israeli scorpion, whose venom is harmless to humans but deadly to its cockroach prey.</description>

      <description>On the drive back from Savannah, Charles and I quickly stopped in to visit the Robins Air Force Base Museum of Aviation. Didn&amp;rsquo;t spend very long there, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much out of the way for the drive back and had a chance to take a few pics. There were some more unusual planes there that I&amp;rsquo;d meant to go back and look up info on, but obviously hadn&amp;rsquo;t since I only just pulled the photos off my camera a few days ago with the rest of the photos from Savannah.</description>

      <description>Finally caught up with going through my photos and uploading to Flickr. Katie was in town visiting this past week (Spring Break). Aside from the holy week activities (choir tired now), one afternoon Amanda and I took off work and all three of us went to the Space &amp;amp; Rocket Center. Lots of interesting historical NASA stuff (early V-2 rockets, Saturn V/Apollo stuff, etc), but I have to admit some of it felt a bit slapped together.</description>

Seems like we also did some very minor maintenance on the cluster we administer there. Anyway, I brought the camera along and had a chance to take a few pics while wandering around the riverfront. Only got around to pulling them off my camera today, so here they are:</description>

      <description>Ran across this site recently, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could describe it any better than the site itself does:
Who would have guessed that when you remove Garfield from the Garfield comic strips, the result is an even better comic about schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the empty desperation of modern life? Friends, meet Jon Arbuckle. Let’s laugh and learn with him on a journey deep into the tortured mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness in a quiet American suburb.</description>

      <description>So my hosting provider (was textdrive, now Joyent) is working on retiring all their old FreeBSD servers they were leasing. Yeah, it hadn&amp;rsquo;t occurred to me that you could lease a server like that. Anyway, they&amp;rsquo;re buying up fancy &amp;ldquo;Shared Accelerators&amp;rdquo; (8-core Opteron boxes with 4GB RAM/core from Sun running OpenSolaris) backed by SunFire x4500 Thumpers running ZFS.
I&amp;rsquo;d started off with this provider a couple years ago as part of a VC campaign (give us a large wad of cash, and we&amp;rsquo;ll give you an account for as long as we&amp;rsquo;re in business), and I&amp;rsquo;d upgraded at some point when they had a similar campaign that bumped up the specs on my hosting account and added their Connector service (group email, calendar, etc services with their own chunk of attached storage) and Strongspace service (large reliable online backup storage accessible via sftp/rsync over ssh/web over ssl).</description>

Time to watch favorites like &amp;ldquo;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&amp;rdquo; (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron Howard) and &amp;ldquo;A Christmas Story&amp;rdquo; (they looked at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears!). Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me before I had a chance to notice. Fortunately I was able to get the little bit of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as bad as I had feared.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been here in Alabama for 2 weeks now. Things seem to be going pretty well so far. We somehow survived the move and I don&amp;rsquo;t think left anything too critical behind. The truck full of half our stuff (and pulling the Civic), the CRV full of cats and guitars, and all the occupants got down here safely and relatively uneventfully. The POD full of the other half of our stuff arrived this past Thursday and we&amp;rsquo;re slowly working on unloading it.</description>

      <description>Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s been a busy week for my flickr photos. I&amp;rsquo;ve had two that were selected for inclusion in various web things.
First, one of my Ireland honeymoon photos was selected for inclusion in Schmap Dublin Third Edition (check out Literary Dublin: Trinity College). Oddly enough, it was a photo I took while we were wandering around Trinity College. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little descriptive blurb from their website:
Exploring a Schmap Guide is a uniquely interactive experience: maps and guide content are dynamically integrated, allowing intuitive, real-time access to reviews and photo slideshows for places of interest.</description>

No, Derek didn&amp;rsquo;t graduate. While one could ask &amp;ldquo;why is he leaving sans-degree&amp;rdquo;, a better question might be &amp;ldquo;why is he referring to himself in the third person?&amp;rdquo; To put it simply, I just got fed up with how things have been going (or not going to be more precise) and decided it was time for a change.</description>

twitter is a bit of an interesting concept as it boils down to very short (less than 140 characters), text-only posts about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. You can post updates in a variety of ways (web, email, im, sms message via cell, desktop client) and receive updates from your circle of twittery friends in a similar way (web, email, im, sms, desktop client, or rss feed).</description>

What prompts me to write this post however is one of the features available on the movie website&amp;hellip; create your own Simpsons avatar! Reasonably well done Flash affair where you select body type, hairstyle, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s of course only a limited number of each of these, but you can achieve a fairly reasonable likeness and save it out as a jpeg.</description>

      <description>In ethology, zugunruhe is anxious behavior in migratory animals that are prevented from migrating, especially in birds. When these animals are enclosed, they exhibit this behaviour during the seasons in which they normally migrate. Behaviourists have been able to study the endocrine controls and navigational mechanisms associated with migration from studying zugunruhe.
This term is German in origin and is a compound of Zug (move, migration) and Unruhe (anxiety, restlessness).</description>

Amanda and I had a very long month when we went down to Huntsville for Mike&amp;rsquo;s wedding. We had our baby Isaac prematurely, and after fighting for three long weeks in the Huntsville NICU, he passed away peacefully in our arms. We&amp;rsquo;re still having a hard time with it, but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s good to talk about it.</description>

      <description>Took some pictures of the snow yesterday and put them up on flickr:
We definitely got a fair bit of snow, and some of the drifts were pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the winds and the city plows concentrated and packed the snow on our side of the street (but it did mean our street was plowed a few times as opposed to the more minor streets that maybe saw one pass&amp;hellip; benefits of being a city and school bus route).</description>

      <description>Apparently the UofI hasn&amp;rsquo;t called a snow day since &amp;lsquo;79. That&amp;rsquo;s close to 30 years of no snow days. They had some silly spokesperson on the news last night that tried to claim we were such a hardy campus and liked to walk everywhere so it took an awful lot to shut us down. Apparently they decided that severe blizzard conditions with 45mph gusts and snow falling way faster than the plows could ever hope to keep up with might actually warrant a snow day.</description>

Continuing high winds and snow have made it impossible to keep streets and sidewalks clear and safe.
Only personnel providing critical services should continue to report for each work shift until further notice. Employees uncertain about their status should direct any questions to their supervisors.

      <description>They give me a little taste, and then take it away. I can&amp;rsquo;t take this kind of abuse. I just need my tasty kibbles. Aaah! Can&amp;rsquo;t they hear me begging for one more hit?
Tried to work out some of my energy leaping at the fun string that makes the light come on. Can you believe they left the lid to the washer open? They&amp;rsquo;re out to get me. I just can&amp;rsquo;t stand the pressure.</description>

      <description>Day 752 of my captivity. Found what I hope is one of my captor&amp;rsquo;s favorite possessions. It appears to be some sort of container for transporting instruments of my exploitation and I believe it to be associated with their obnoxious light flashing device.
I have thoroughly inspected it&amp;rsquo;s contents to ascertain if it might hold anything I could use in my escape. Having found nothing, I destroyed it&amp;rsquo;s lining with my claws and ate the outer edges to prevent its further use.</description>

      <description>Day 746 of my captivity. My captors continued to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal.
The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from clawing the furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant.
Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been expecting to hear this for a while, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a bummer to find out that The Reputation have officially broken up. In Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s words:
As I&amp;rsquo;m guessing many of you have already figured out, the band is over.
Sean quit. Rest of us just gave up, I guess. I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have plans to do any more music or play any more shows. Breaks my fucking heart.</description>

      <description>Have some pics up from my trip to the bay area up at Flickr:
Was a good trip overall. Real good to see Richy and Carrie and get to hang out with them some and see some sights. Got up to the Golden Gate bridge, although didn&amp;rsquo;t see that much since it was really foggy. Headed down to the Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf and wandered around there for a while checking out the sea lions and Ghirardelli and such.</description>

Fortunately, I get to head out to San Jose this Sunday to visit with Rich and Carrie&amp;hellip; oh yeah and go to ASPLOS (Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems). Looks like it should be an interesting conference and the best part is I don&amp;rsquo;t have to foot the bill. :)</description>

      <description>Rachel came down to visit this past weekend and we caught the show at the Courtyard Cafe Saturday night. I was really wanting to catch Elizabeth Elmore again with the rest of her band, The Reputation, and had heard they were to go on third which in theory would be around 10:30. Not wanting to miss them, I figured we should get there by 10 just to be sure, and probably got there a fair bit before that since we caught the tail end of the first act, Judah Johnson.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to it for a few weeks since I read about it, and managed to catch Elizabeth Elmore playing solo at the Courtyard Cafe in the Union. Free show no less. There were pretty clearly only a handful of people that were explicitly there to attend the show and an assortment of others that were there just eating their lunch or studying or what-not. Good show though. Just her and her electric (Gibson SG I believe).</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; to the bikini. Or at least that&amp;rsquo;s what I saw on the news this morning. Guess it must have been a slow news day with all the terror threats about flights from the UK heading to the US and all. Or maybe that was just one of those silly morning shows I caught and not really the news&amp;hellip;
The bikini&amp;rsquo;s been around for 60 years, although I guess it really made it&amp;rsquo;s debut back in Paris on July 5, 1946 and was invented in May of that year.</description>

Champaign Drivers Test Goes Wrong
2 people are rushed to the hospital after a driver crashes through a window at the Department of Motor Vehicles In Champaign.
The 27-year-old man taking his driving test.
One person inside was hit.
And the instructor, riding in that car, was also hurt.
Apparently the guy drove all the way into the waiting area. Like ALL the way. I thought this stuff was reserved for South Floridians&amp;hellip; And is it just me, or is that a really strange, terse blurb the news people put on their website?</description>

First, I broke the nice set of Sennheiser HD515 cans I use at work leaving me with the craptacular closed Aiwas I&amp;rsquo;d used before seeing the light. Then, I broke the belt clip on my cellphone. Fortunately, superglue seems to have solved both problems.
Then, I realized my Thinkpad wasn&amp;rsquo;t charging like it should. Everything indicated it was charging, but the battery meter kept getting lower.</description>

      <description>Rachel and her roommate Tammy (who&amp;rsquo;s a hoot btw) came down Friday night to catch the show at the Canopy Club featuring The Living Blue, Tractor Kings, Dark Country, and The Dolphin. We showed up some time during the Dolphin&amp;rsquo;s set and all I have to say is weird. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell whether they were playing something or just getting setup and making random noises on-stage. We elected to wait out at the bar until after their set was over.</description>

      <description>So Google seems to be releasing all sorts of cool tech these days. You&amp;rsquo;ve got Gmail, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty pleased with (all my email accounts forward there now). There&amp;rsquo;s Google Bookmarks that I think are tied into their &amp;ldquo;personalized home&amp;rdquo; stuff. I know you can view/add them via the Google toolbar in IE, but last I knew there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an equivalent for browsers that don&amp;rsquo;t suck (eg Firefox). It&amp;rsquo;s kinda nice to have a web-based place for me to store bookmarks (so I can access them at home/work/etc), but I wish there was a better way to add links independent of the IE toolbar (eg a button to add a bookmark vs.</description>

      <description>Lee and I trekked up to Chicago to catch The New Pornographers / Belle &amp;amp; Sebastian play at the Riviera Friday night.
I handled travel plans (directions to the Park&amp;amp;Ride; station where we parked and caught the &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rdquo;, trains to take, transfers to make, how to get to the theater, last train we&amp;rsquo;d have to catch). Pretty uneventful trip for the most part. The most interesting part was how the bike lane to the side of the road in Chicago was used as a thug passing lane by many.</description>

      <description>manscaping: to groom a man. Shaving, waxing, cleaning up the superfluous fur.
Courtest of the Urban Dictionary. A collaborative (think wikipedia) dictionary for modern slang. Found out about this earlier this week on the Rep yahoo group. Since a lot of slang is a bit crude in nature, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to warn you that this site may offend some of the prudish folk out there. You&amp;rsquo;ve been warned&amp;hellip; I could probably spend all day looking through that site.</description>

      <description>We adopted our third kitty this past Saturday thanks to Amanda&amp;rsquo;s sister Katie. She&amp;rsquo;d found him as a stray hanging around the house of some of her boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s friends down in Carbondale. Seems there&amp;rsquo;s a BIG stray cat problem down in that neck of the woods (presumably because of all the college students in the area, and their decision to ditch their cats when they move). I think the call she made to Amanda about the kitty went something like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a bit farther in my updates for Malkier. I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed how I&amp;rsquo;d set up the databases. Basically I realized webmin had greater flexibility for creating databases than phpMyAdmin is currently set up to support. Things are nicely organized now in that respect. I&amp;rsquo;ve also upgraded to the latest version of WordPress, so I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten all those goodies and bugfixes now.
The main task left is to do some customization and update the style for my site.</description>

      <description>Part way through switching over to K2. Looks like I need to fine tune the custom page themes I&amp;rsquo;ve previously created (for movies and header_graphics). They work at present, but the two column setup isn&amp;rsquo;t really formatted right under the new theme.
I also want to set up a new header graphic, probably tweak the color scheme, and maybe look into some other cool options/extensions (such as embedding a flickr feed in the sidebar).</description>

DNS now points to my new server. Email has all been transferred over (hooray for IMAP!). My databases are up and running (although not set up quite how Iâ€™d like). The blog is functional (along with most of the site, since I&amp;rsquo;m using WordPress as a basic content management system for a large portion of the site). My movies page is functional.</description>

      <description>Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m finally going to get around to moving Malkier over to a new server.
iPowerWeb has been decent as far as hosting providers go, but they&amp;rsquo;re clearly targetting a different market than whatever category I fall into. They provide (read: push) a bunch of web business stuff, but don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be quite as concerned with cool webtech or security. The server I&amp;rsquo;m on has been hit by security flaws on a few occasions, resulting in either server downtime or mass defacement of the php source throughout my site&amp;hellip; inserted spam code in every php file on my site&amp;hellip; Funny because it pointed to a non-existent web address and was written in such a way that every page it was on was broken and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even render in a browser.</description>

      <description>Caught Andrew Bird last night with Lee at the Canopy Club. Impressive live show. I was really amazed how much can come out of so few people. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard Andrew Bird, his music has lots going on. Very melodic. The show (and presumably his album too) was performed by two people using slick audio equipment. They&amp;rsquo;d play several measures on one instrument, loop it, then play along to it with other stuff.</description>

Can&amp;rsquo;t beat the price either. $8 cover for 3 bands playing a 45 minute set each. And Lee and I were right up there by the stage. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t get much closer without completely losing my hearing. :) A good time was definitely had by all.</description>

      <description>So recently I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking a fair bit about how good some old DOS games were back in the day. The ones that really came to mind were the Ultima series (particularly U6: The False Prophet, U7: The Black Gate, and U7: Serpent Isle). Those were outstanding games. I&amp;rsquo;d done a bit of research and found DOSBox, which allows you to play a wide range of old DOS games on an assortment of platforms (ie it performs x86/DOS emulation).</description>

Not so fun and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised Amanda didn&amp;rsquo;t kill me for wasting her limited vacation time in this manner, but at least we got to go to Monkey Jungle.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering from some bad computer mojo as of recent.
First our group fileserver tanked. Not that I really came into physical contact with it, but I talked to it over the network all the time. Then my brand spankin&amp;rsquo; new NAS drive (got a Buffalo LinkStation, basically an external hard drive enclosure with ethernet instead of USB/Firewire) had some sort of catastrophic firmware failure while I was using it and I was forced to RMA it.</description>

      <description>What an unbelievable waste of time. Some state law passed last year (at least I assume last year&amp;hellip; I started having to do this last year anyway) requires that all state employees must go through ethics training every year. Interesting how grad students are considered employees when it means additional requirements/constraints be placed on us and students when they&amp;rsquo;re talking about salary/benefits/parking/etc. Fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s done through the web instead of requiring us to attend an actual class.</description>

Traditional wisdom would suggest it&amp;rsquo;s much better to design the heck out of two very powerful processors and ease the parallel programming burden to achieve high performance.</description>

Previously, their &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo; line of notebooks (aka PowerBooks) topped out at a piddly 1440x900 on a 17&amp;quot; LCD. Just think about that a moment. My Thinkbrick (that&amp;rsquo;s a couple years old at this point) does 1400x1050 on a 14&amp;quot; display. Their 15&amp;quot; was equally pathetic at 1280x854. They&amp;rsquo;ve just bumped up the 15&amp;quot; model to 1440x960 and the 17&amp;quot; to 1680x1050.</description>

      <description>I should really pay closer attention to who joins our department. Nikita Borisov apparently just started here this semester and is currently doing work on anonymous peer-to-peer networks. Nick introduced him to Jeff and I today with the intention of giving him some of our spare computers to get his group started.
Afterwards I took a look at his past work and realized he was one of the primary architects for Off-the-Record Messaging that I use in Gaim (Linux/Windows) and AdiumX (OSX).</description>

For those not in the know, Sanjay&amp;rsquo;s a professor in the ECE department here at UIUC and has been working as chief architect at AGEIA for a while now. AGEIA has been developing a custom physics processor to improve gaming performance/experience by pushing all such calculations onto a dedicated chip thus freeing up the cpu and the gpu to do what they do best (ie handle the ai and such and push pixels).</description>

      <description>Fairly recently, the company that made our group fileserver was bought up by Sun. So we&amp;rsquo;re not really sure whether we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to renew our service contract (which runs out October 20th), or if we&amp;rsquo;ll be forced to buy a new Sun fileserver at a discount. The cynic in all of us should know what&amp;rsquo;s coming next&amp;hellip;
On Friday, our group fileserver sorta flaked. Took the admins an hour or more to get it back up and running, and when it did our current group mount (ie the one with all the stuff I really care about right now) did not come up with it.</description>

      <description>What a relief! Just got news the RAID card has come in, was installed, and with a fair bit of manual tinkering the admins managed to restore access to our unbacked-up mount. They&amp;rsquo;re in the process of migrating the data elsewhere and we should have a temporary workaround up and running in short order. Looks like we haven&amp;rsquo;t lost anything since some files have access times from last Friday. Will have to do some testing to see if anything was corrupted, but I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a whole lot better about it than I was earlier today.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ve gone back to more of a realistic look from the cel-shaded cartoony stuff of Wind Waker. Not that Wind Waker wasn&amp;rsquo;t cool. But it sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s getting pushed back from November to some time after next March or so (according to IGN). Man, this was announced back in August. Where was I? I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to this game too.</description>

      <title>What the... Nintendo&#39;s new controller?</title>

      <description>Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s finally announced the controller for their next-gen console (the Revolution). Does anyone besides me find it bizarre?
Sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s somewhere between a one-handed tv remote and an old power glove? There are apparently a couple of sensors placed near the tv plus a sensor in the remote that detect position and orientation. They plan on supporting other &amp;ldquo;more traditional&amp;rdquo; controller types (conventional controller shells, dance mats, bongos, etc) by slipping the remote inside these other add-ons.</description>

      <description>Finally got the site back up. Turns out there was some sort of security breach this past weekend that slipped evil javascript into all of my php/html pages on the site. Looked like it was intended to be some sort of browser buffer overflow attack or something along those lines (the support folk at ipowerweb said it would download a virus?). Anyway, things should be cleared up and safe again for now.</description>

      <description>So I broke down and bought a new mp3 player to take with me when I go jogging&amp;hellip; well jogging/walking&amp;hellip; well really more walking than jogging, but I&amp;rsquo;m still building up toward that. Anyway, looks like it should be a pretty cute little unit. Key features:
It&amp;rsquo;s about a 1&amp;quot; cube has a little OLED display comes in 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB versions (I got the 512) has an FM radio (can even record it at up to 160kbps) 8-10 hours of battery life when playing mp3s USB2.</description>

Be sure to go check out the trailer. I really don&amp;rsquo;t remember the show having quite that much plot. :)</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been some rumors making their way through the geek community that Google has been working on its own IM service (ala ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, etc). Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s live! Mike was ever so kind as to hook me up with an invite, and it seems fairly slick so far. Appears that anyone with a Gmail account can use it.
They&amp;rsquo;ve only got a Windows client that integrates with your Gmail account and even supports voice chats, but their server&amp;rsquo;s running Jabber (opensource IM server).</description>

      <description>I know this was posted last week on slashdot, but it looks like the website for OpenSUSE finally went live. Pretty exciting stuff. First RedHat split their distro into a commercial, &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; class distro and the bleeding-edge, completely open distro Fedora (open in the sense that more than just RedHat employees were actively contributing to its development and direction). Now Novell has opened up SUSE. If I remember correctly, it used to be an exclusively commercial distro if I remember correctly&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t available for free download.</description>

      <description>Apple is full of interesting surprises this year. First they announced they&amp;rsquo;d be ditching PowerPC in favor of x86. Now, they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and released a multibutton mouse. But without any buttons. Er&amp;hellip; something like that.
In place of buttons, it features touch-sensitive capacitive sensors beneath the top shell (ala the iPod) that &amp;ldquo;detect where your fingers are and predict your clicking intentions&amp;rdquo;. Or at least that&amp;rsquo;s according to their marketing speak.</description>

Managed to stumble over Angie Heaton who has a few albums out. Was listening to her when Amanda asked me who that was&amp;hellip; when I told her, she said Rachel had listened to her. I took that as a cue to ask Rachel what she listened to next time I saw her.</description>

      <description>Amanda&amp;rsquo;s Cingular contract finally ran out on Monday, so we ran out and switched to Verizon last night. I&amp;rsquo;d always been pretty happy with my Cingular service, but I was using their old CDMA network (that they stopped selling new phones for over 2 years ago) and a carefully selected phone. And my phone was getting pretty long in the tooth&amp;hellip; I was largely content with the feature set but the battery could get 3 days or so on standby (pretty darned good for a 3+ year old phone I&amp;rsquo;d say).</description>

They don&amp;rsquo;t provide us with free espresso-based beverages, they don&amp;rsquo;t provide us with a convenient places to buy espresso-based beverages, and now they&amp;rsquo;re mugging us on the sodas. How are grad students supposed to work into the wee hours without a cheap source of caffeine? :( Might have to just start bringing my own.</description>

Headed up there Friday morning and hit the Shedd Aquarium, apparently oldest aquarium in the country (founded 75 years ago). Since we were planning on hitting lots of museums, we picked up &amp;ldquo;city passes&amp;rdquo; that include admission to a number of different sites in the area (if you see more than two of the six, I think you made out well).</description>

      <description>This is a test post from , a fancy photo sharing thing.
Pretty cool. Looks like flickr will let you upload 20M of photos per month, and makes the last 200 you&amp;rsquo;ve posted visible. Has assorted useful features such as tagging photos, controlling who can see photos, etc. Seems pretty cool. I might just use it some for more temporary stuff (ie stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t want to archive on the web forever and take up precious space on my webhost).</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s definitely hacky at this point (made a custom wordpress page style containing most of the php code and simply created an empty page that uses that style), but at least it works. Still need to refine it some. I stripped out most of the db fields from getting displayed since I&amp;rsquo;m don&amp;rsquo;t have as much screen width to work with, but I should fine tune what I display.</description>

Engadget has some analysis on the decision, but I guess it largely boils down to limitations they&amp;rsquo;ve experienced with the PowerPC platform.

      <description>So I did a little more research into the gottlieb.* domain names. I had considered something along those lines before ending up with malkier.com since all the appropriate gottlieb stuff was taken. Most are held by legitimate parties (ie people/businesses with the name gottlieb), but gottlieb.net is actually being squatted on by a rather shifting looking domain service, buydomains.com. Turns out these scumbags run around buying up domains with the hopes that someone would buy them for a pretty penny.</description>

Spooky likes to play in the big soup pot Silly kitties! And now that my folks have come to visit the grand-kitties (don&amp;rsquo;t ask&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t coin the phrase), they have all sorts of new cat toys to play with.</description>

      <description>The big E3 entertainment expo featured the first real info on the next generation game consoles. Xbox360 features a PowerPC with 3 cores, graphics by ATI, some backwards compatibility. PS3 features a beastly PowerPC-based Cell processor (ie roughly twice the flops of the Xbox360), graphics by Nvidia, Blu-Ray support, and full backwards compatibility (PS1 and PS2). Very limited details on the Nintendo Revolution: backwards compatible with Gamecube games, support for downloading old school Nintendo games (NES, SNES, N64&amp;hellip; not sure how the pricing scheme will work for this).</description>

      <description>Star Wars: Episode III is out! And it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be good. Very dark, but good. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it actually does a good job wrapping things up and bridging the new with the old. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get to see it before too long (headed out of town to go to Amanda&amp;rsquo;s cousin&amp;rsquo;s wedding tomorrow and my folks will be here next week). Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a fairly high quality work print has been leaked.</description>

      <description>As I suspected, the 10.4.1 update for Tiger has been released. Looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve fixed quite a number of things (seems to have possibly solved some of the crashes/lockups I&amp;rsquo;d experienced so far&amp;hellip; at least, don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve had one since I updated).</description>

      <description>So it would seem that the release of iTunes by Apple largely killed off the other music playing apps (ie mp3 players). Which is lame because I find the interface a little bulky, doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like I can have it sort based on directory structure, and I find it a little annoying that by default it wants to copy all of your music to a &amp;ldquo;My Music&amp;rdquo; type folder when you import new stuff.</description>

      <description>Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly news. But I&amp;rsquo;ve randomly run into some more food oddities. I say randomly because I ran across it on this guy&amp;rsquo;s del.icio.us bookmarks (he wrote Cocoalicious, a slick del.icio.us client for OS X). Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s the link. Featured are the Luther Burger (a bacon cheeseburger served on a toasted Krispy Kreme bun) and the Hamdog (a hot dog wrapped in a beef patty that&amp;rsquo;s deep fried, covered with chili, cheese and onions, and served on a hoagie bun topped with a fried egg and two fistfuls of fries).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few of these around town. Apparently the park district is spinning them as restoring some of the land controlled by the park district to it&amp;rsquo;s original &amp;ldquo;prairie&amp;rdquo; condition. In practice, I think this largely translates to &amp;ldquo;um, this is too much work, so we&amp;rsquo;re just going to stop mowing some of these and put up a sign.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve always found the park district to be rather interesting around here.</description>

      <description>Amanda was telling me that the mayor of Detroit (who&amp;rsquo;s apparently assisted in creating a 300 million dollar deficit) has proposed an additional tax on fast-food to help fill the city&amp;rsquo;s coffers. Guess this is a strategic move since Detroit&amp;rsquo;s ranked third on the list of &amp;ldquo;fattest cities&amp;rdquo; (following Houston and Chicago)&amp;hellip;
On a related note, I saw this other article at CNN about a restaurant that&amp;rsquo;s started selling a 15-pound burger!</description>

      <description>Looks like Tiger&amp;rsquo;s new Dashboard could use some refinement when it comes to security. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s pretty trivial to make a user auto-download a widget when they visit a webpage in Safari, it&amp;rsquo;ll then auto-install if they&amp;rsquo;re using the default Safari settings, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll be running a potentially very obnoxious (and possibly even malicious) widget that&amp;rsquo;s impossible for average Joe user to remove. With any luck they&amp;rsquo;ll refine this a bit in 10.</description>

      <description>Looks like Apples&amp;rsquo;s released Java 1.5 for Tiger. Not quite sure why people aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about this (was released same day as Tiger&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; release date) since a lot of people had mentioned it being present in the Tiger developer test releases and that it was absent from the final version released to the public. Looks like I can finally see about getting Liberty&amp;rsquo;s LSE up and running on OS X.</description>

      <description>Saw this Slashdot post. A student at CMU made a website parodying the Wal-Mart Foundation (a thinly veiled attempt to improve the parent corp&amp;rsquo;s public image through small scattered donations) for a class on &amp;ldquo;Parasitic Media&amp;rdquo;. Guess Wal-Mart didn&amp;rsquo;t take too kindly to how they were portrayed, so they whipped out that horrendous piece of legeslation, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA&amp;rsquo;s a vague wording allows large corporations with lots of cash to easily threaten things they don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>

      <description>Talked about this earlier. Managed to take some more pictures today and actually load them onto my computer (as opposed to deleting them accidently again. In addition to Optimus Prime, there were several milk carton people (only took a picture of one, but may go back for more later), a giant fork (didn&amp;rsquo;t take a picture because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as enthralled by it, and it looked like it was slightly broken), a burning foosball player, and a really bizarre one involving a giant beetle pushing a dirt clod with a human fetus inside.</description>

      <description>Finally got around to loading up some of my older kitty pics that were on my other camera. They start off with Spooky attacking Space Chicken when he was a little bitty kitten, and moves on to the cats playing with each other and a box.
On a related note, I did take my camera in to work today, and I did take pictures of the cardboard sculptures in Beckman. Unfortunately, when I went to download them onto my computer I accidently deleted them instead of downloading them (bit of a usability issue with Picasa IMHO).</description>

      <description>So there&amp;rsquo;s this art class on campus that does fairly large sculptures out of cardboard. At the end of the semester, the students showcase their work out on the quad and apparently other places on campus. Saw the coolest (read: geekiest) one today in the main atrium/lobby in Beckman&amp;hellip; a 10 foot tall Optimus Prime!!! That thing rules! I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to try to remember to bring a camera with me tomorrow to document it.</description>

Recently found out Fedora Core 4 will include it, which made me a little wary of trying it out (seems like it took a while for the GCC3 release to settle down and for apps to fix compatibility issues). Weird thing is, I was looking through a feature comparison for OS X (Tiger.</description>

When I went to drop off my Rentertainment DVDs today, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice the sidewalk chalk ads everywhere for a 9mm raffle being held today on the Quad.

On a related note, I finally got around to uploading some more kitty pictures. Been having hardware problems with my CompactFlash reader (took forever to get it to mount, took forever to get a directory listing, took forever to transfer the files, and some of the files were corrupted by the time they got to my computer).</description>

      <description>TV on DVD is so very cool. After a recommendation from Lee (not to mention my own curiosity), I rented the first disc of Joss Whedon&amp;rsquo;s Firefly a few weeks back. Really enjoyed it, so I ended up buying it. Good stuff.
Sticking with the trend, I decided to go rent the first couple of discs for BBC&amp;rsquo;s MI-5. It had piqued my interest previously, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to looking for it until the recent issue of Wired reminded me.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to hold off on buying a new PC for the foreseeable future. Have been wanting to put together a new gaming box with a semi-current graphics card so that I could play some games. My old Athlon box, polonius, is a bit long in the tooth, and my notebook, laertes, just doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite cut it on everything. My Dell box, horatio, is fairly current (P4/2.4GHz) from the clunky video (GeForce 4 MX), but until recently I enjoyed using it exclusively as an always-on Linux box.</description>

      <description>Ack! My pants are on fire. Was just perusing the gcc website when I noticed they&amp;rsquo;re refering to it as the GNU Compiler Collection. Hmm. Wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s always been that way, or just since they added other languages&amp;hellip;
Edit: Dug around their wiki some more. Looks like it used to be GNU C Compiler (at least the initial release was), just as I thought.</description>

      <description>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d be complaining about how hot it is in winter. Truth be told, it&amp;rsquo;s ass cold outside. But when I came into the office today it was close to 90 degrees in there! I&amp;rsquo;ve propped the door open and tried to get in touch with Dan the friendly building manager guy any way possible. I think they&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked something since it&amp;rsquo;s started to come down (about 86 now), but it&amp;rsquo;s taking a while.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t know what made me think of it this morning, but I was remembering something my first programming teacher said. He was teaching a course in introductory C programming for engineering applications and we were using gcc as our compiler. At the time, he claimed GCC stood for Good C Compiler. Seems pretty suspect since the gcc most everyone knows is actually the GNU C Compiler since it&amp;rsquo;s been developed by the GNU organization which was founded back in 1984 (although the first release of gcc wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 1987, but that was long before I took this course).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve switched IM clients already. Fire just wasn&amp;rsquo;t as featureful/configurable as I would like, so I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Adium X. Got Firefox for the pages that don&amp;rsquo;t work right in Safari. Fink of course for additional Unix goodies (mostly extra compilation stuff). SSHKeychain provides a convenient interface to ssh-agent and simplifies key management. DoubleCommand lets me remap some keys (ie I can make my Ctrl key act like an Apple Command key), and the next version should differentiate between left and right keys allowing me to have both a Ctrl and a Command key (since Ctrl is sorta essential for emacs).</description>

      <description>So the pages feature looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be pretty slick. I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to set up the main frontpage for the site so that it loads up the page I created inside of WP. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s the most efficient way to do it, but it does work. Definitely looks like WP is well on it&amp;rsquo;s way to being a fairly complete CMS (content management system). Will have to see if I can differentiate between blog pages and normal content pages so that I can have a reduced sidebar for all things not blog.</description>

      <description>As you may notice, I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of upgrading my WordPress install for the blog. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d gotten the key stuff translated over to the new setup, so I switched over to the new stuff. While my blog looks mostly right (sans access buttons in the header), I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten that a lot of the rest of my site was using chunks of old blog code for their appearance. Hence, when I swapped them out, the rest of the stuff tanked.</description>

      <description>Slowly making progress on the transition to 1.5. You&amp;rsquo;ll note I sorta have the links back up in the header, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t formatted like the rest of the site quite yet&amp;hellip; And I still need to integrate the rest of the site with the new theme code instead of having to keep around the old blog code.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a mock-up of the malkier frontpage that you can see here.</description>

      <description>Our kitties are silly! Apparently, one of our fuzzy blankets reminds Spooky an awful lot of his mama, because he&amp;rsquo;s taken to kneading, suckling, and lapping on it. I was petting him this morning (in an attempt to keep him from completely waking me up) when he started in on the blanket. He had to be going at that thing for at least half an hour. Silly kitty.
Even worse&amp;hellip; Miss Merry was getting a little old when we adopted her, but I thought vaccinations should be top priority.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the mini for a couple of days now, and so far I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m impressed. Cute little box and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve largely been impressed with the speed and &amp;ldquo;fluidity&amp;rdquo; of it. OS X seems awful slick so far, barring the inevitable learning curve. In fairly short order I&amp;rsquo;d found the Terminal and was greeted with a familiar bash prompt and even things like emacs (text-only) and ssh out of the box.</description>

      <description>Turns out Anandtech has started providing some Mac coverage. Anand starts off with A Month with a Mac: A Die-Hard PC User&amp;rsquo;s Perspective providing his take on the Mac experience to the &amp;ldquo;uninitiated&amp;rdquo; with a hefty Dual-G5 desktop. This led to the mobile experience with a Powerbook. Most recently, he&amp;rsquo;s taken a look at the Mac mini.</description>

      <description>Went to the Castle Theater in Bloomington yesterday with Amanda to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Really outstanding theater setup. Instead of the usual uncomfortable, cramped stadium seating, the Castle has a set of squishy couches and loveseats. Much more enjoyable experience. Raiders is such a classic.</description>

      <description>Macworld has lots of good coverage on the Mac mini. They&amp;rsquo;ve got a nice review with benchmark results, discussion of some of the available options, and even some cool findings (looks like some of the 40GB machines come with 5400rpm drives instead of 4200, and some systems may come with faster RAM, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it&amp;rsquo;s actually being clocked any higher than PC2700). They&amp;rsquo;ve got coverage on disassembly with lots of pictures (opening it up and stripping it down to bare components).</description>

      <description>Got a couple of song lyrics related websites for you. I rarely have a clue what the artist/author means when they create something, be it abstract painting, poetry, or song lyrics. So I found songmeanings.net of some interest. On a related note, have you ever heard little kids singing a song (or the pledge of allegience). As a group, they usually sound about right, but if you listen to them individually, you hear some rather bizarre stuff that sounds about right, but is totally wrong.</description>

So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve converted over the pages about the senior design project I developed with John, the UR-5beta. Figure I may put up a copy of my public key at some point, but since the only one I use with any regularity is already up at my CRHC site, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure there&amp;rsquo;s much point.</description>

      <description>Finally bit the bullet and ordered myself a Mac mini. There&amp;rsquo;s a good 3-4 week lead time on them currently, so I still have time to back out if I get cold feet. But I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a machine that&amp;rsquo;d run OS X for some time now. Every so often I look into &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; used Macs on fleabay, but have always been thwarted by the remarkably high prices that old Macs go for.</description>

Both kitties have now had their vaccinations: Merry has had the full set of rabies and FVRCP shots, and Spooky had his first dose of the FVRCP today. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to take him back in another month for the FVRCP booster, and then a month or two after that for rabies.</description>

Some fellow has the video up on his blog (wonder how long he&amp;rsquo;ll survive the slashdot effect). I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to snag the video already, so if he does go down, I may make it available to interested parties. A review site has also gotten their hands on a bare motherboard.</description>

      <description>So the Macworld Expo started yesterday. The big deal as I see it is the announcement of the Mac mini. That&amp;rsquo;s actually got me kinda excited. It&amp;rsquo;s a cute, little sub-$500 Mac that&amp;rsquo;ll run OS X. The dimensions on this thing are quite impressive (6.5&amp;quot; x 6.5&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot;). That&amp;rsquo;s awful tiny. Comes with a 1.25GHz G4, a 40GB ATA HDD, DVD/CD-RW, 256MB DDR RAM, 32MB Radeon 9200 DVI, and the usual plethora of I/O (10/100 ethernet, modem, audio out, Firewire, USB2).</description>

      <description>So in my Christmas stocking this year I got a Mitch Hedberg CD, Strategic Grill Locations. I&amp;rsquo;d seen him on Comedy Central some time back and found him absolutely hilarious. He&amp;rsquo;s got this funny, stoner sort of vibe and just cranks out all sorts of oddball, inane comments that are really entertaining. If you are a follower of my blog, you may have already noticed that I have a number of his quotes that randomly appear in the sidebar.</description>

      <description>We adopted our second kitty this past Sunday. He is an adorable 8-week old black and white kitten. He&amp;rsquo;s predominantly black with a little white stripe down his nose, a white chin and tummy, and white paws. As per the suggestion of his previous home (one of Amanda&amp;rsquo;s co-workers), we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to call him Spooky. I kept thinking of the X-Files (Fox &amp;ldquo;Spooky&amp;rdquo; Mulder), and he seems to spook pretty easily for a kitty as curious and fearless as he appears to be.</description>

So what better to catch the essence of something like Malkier? An old castle of course! Dug through some of my Ireland photos and came up with that pic of Blarney castle.</description>

      <description>So last weekend (not yesterday but a week before that) Amanda and I went to Bloomington to meet up with a couple of her friends from work to go see a comedy show. It was held in a dive bar (didn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that bad by campus bar standards, but it definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ritzy comedy club either), and featured the Disgruntled Clown. He&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;ex-ex-stepfather&amp;rdquo; of one of Amanda&amp;rsquo;s friends (we&amp;rsquo;re not quite sure what&amp;rsquo;s meant by the ex-ex- part&amp;hellip; not the last ex-stepfather, but the one before that?</description>

      <description>So it seems LBB (that&amp;rsquo;s Little Boy Blazejack) has finally come into his own. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know him, he&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; brother of someone I went to high school with. Those of us who knew him always wondered if he would eventually find himself gainfully employed and at the same time doing something he enjoyed. Last I knew, I think he was getting ready to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a major in photojournalism.</description>

      <description>Well, I finally broke down and bought myself a photo printer.
I&amp;rsquo;d been surviving until recently with a close to 10 year old, increasingly finicky laser printer. It&amp;rsquo;s served me well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had paper feed issues with it for quite some time (ie years) and have been somewhat limited by its inability to make pretty color prints and its dismal speed (did I mention it was an old parallel port model).</description>

      <description>So this update is long overdue. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really busy recently with&amp;hellip; well, life. First there was the big annual ISCA crunch where I helped Jim get his submission from 0 to paper in less than a week. Part of that was help getting him up and running on NCSA&amp;rsquo;s Itanium-2 cluster (Teragrid) so that he could have results to write about. The other part was helping him get an actual paper together the day of the deadline since Nick was focused on the other project he wanted to submit for.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s substantially faster than old Mozilla/Netscape, standards compliant (unlike IE), less likely to allow your machine to be filled with spyware (unlike IE), has all sorts of cool extensions to add additional functionality (even redefine existing functionality)&amp;hellip; oh and it won&amp;rsquo;t give you the plague either (unlike IE)! ;) It&amp;rsquo;s just dripping in plague juice!</description>

      <description>Mmmm. Wood floors. Got solid oak installed downstairs over the past couple of days. Really looks outstanding. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bunch of pics up at the usual place, but they simply don&amp;rsquo;t do it justice. If you have a chance to come see, do so! :) Got an estimate for putting ceramic tile in the kitchen and bathrooms, and replacing the rest of the carpet (stairs and upstairs hall/bedrooms) with new carpet.</description>

      <description>Making progress again on the house (and remembered to bring my camera again too). A bunch of the double-paned windows that had broken seals were replaced on Tuesday (turns out some of the remaining windows were misordered and the sliding glass door is on backorder). Big improvement on the ones that have been replaced though. Will actually be able to look out the windows now. Got the light green paint up on two of the walls in the dining room (but not the overhang near the cathedral ceiling), gold along the north wall with the big picture window in the living room and the sliding glass door in the dining room that leads to the deck.</description>

      <description>So apparently Dell is now shipping a 20&amp;quot; widescreen LCD ala the Apple Cinema dispay. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s got pretty sweet specs in addition to being priced several hundred less than Apple&amp;rsquo;s. Now if only Dell would have some outrageous deal on it. :)

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been drooling over new MP3 players recently. There&amp;rsquo;s been all sorts of activity in iPod-land. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the 4th gen iPods that bump battery life up to ~12 hours per charge. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the U2 Special Edition iPod that comes in a snazzy black color scheme with a sharply contrasting red click-wheel, band member autographs engraved on the back, and a $50 iTunes coupon good toward the purchase of &amp;ldquo;The Complete U2&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that only partially covers the price of admission, and isn&amp;rsquo;t all that great a deal since they&amp;rsquo;ve bumped up the price of the unit by $50).</description>

      <description>Ok. Ran across this weird site this morning when I was perusing suprnova. The link is howtodogirls.com. Yeah, I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. Some sort of perverse instructional site. Well, you&amp;rsquo;d be right, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably not exactly what you&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind. Apparently, they&amp;rsquo;ve got a few bikini models who will do a variety of instructional videos (the episode that&amp;rsquo;s currently available is titled &amp;ldquo;Intro to Bikini Calculus&amp;rdquo;). So it&amp;rsquo;s really more of a bunch of girls doing &amp;ldquo;how-to (do)&amp;rdquo; videos instead of &amp;ldquo;how-to-do-girls&amp;rdquo; videos&amp;hellip; Weird.</description>

      <description>So it seems some of the spammers have picked up on my blog for some reason. I&amp;rsquo;ve started receiving a lot of very spammy comments as of recent (ie one &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; slowly iterating over all blog posts starting at #1, each post being largely nonsense but containing a gambling link in the homepage section). So I&amp;rsquo;ve turned on comment moderation for anything phishy. With any luck this will at least prevent anything from ever showing up on the blog itself, but it still means I&amp;rsquo;ll get alerts about them (which I may eventually turn off if it grows to frequent) and have to go through and clear them out every so often.</description>

      <description>Got some more info on all of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s hub-bub. Apparently, one of the Lieberts (air conditioners) blew up in the server room yesterday, spraying cold water everywhere. The admins spent all day yesterday cleaning up the mess (disassembling the servers, cleaning them out, drying everying, testing them, etc). The main servers are all back up as of this morning, so email, home directories, and the firewall are all available again. The bad news is our group fileserver was directly in front of the Liebert when it blew up.</description>

      <description>I got an unexpected day off today. Things were all hunky dorey this morning, but then around 11 something happened. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely clear on what. Sounded like someone was doing some sort of maintenance work down in the basement, something went boom, and several fire sprinklers went off in the machine room. Needless to say, the admins quickly shut everything down and went about cleaning up the mess, drying out all the computers and trying to get everything shifted over to another room.</description>

      <description>So everyone&amp;rsquo;s been raving about this del.icio.us thing. Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s a big online, social bookmarking site. You set up an account, add your bookmarks to it, and categorize them with tags of your choosing (i.e. instead of simple folders, you can associate a link with tags &amp;ldquo;programming&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; so that you can access it when you click on either the programming or C categories). Social aspect comes into play when you look at who else has posted a given bookmark, or who else has posted stuff in a given category, or what the most popular links of the day are, etc etc etc.</description>

      <description>Amanda and I have been pretty busy since we closed on the house. We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at flooring some, and I&amp;rsquo;ve started the ball rolling on fixing the windows (several of the double panes had broken seals). We&amp;rsquo;ve also done a fair bit of painting, sanding, staining, sealing, spackling, de-wallpapering, cleaning, landscaping&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep a pretty good photo log of our progress over in the gallery. Basically, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a full tour of the house as it was at closing, and then a separate album tracking our progress in each room.</description>

      <description>So slashdot had an interesting IT review link today: Juvenile felis catus (or &amp;ldquo;kitten&amp;rdquo; for you laymen). Full of very cute pictures, a lot of tongue-in-cheek commentary, and links to all sorts of amusing/geeky/just plain weird sites (standard kitten package and CAT Users&amp;rsquo; Manual). Oh, and he even provides a convenient summary comparison against competing models (i.e. puppies, babies, or a new video card). Now that Amanda and I have a house, we&amp;rsquo;ll get to start looking for kittens before long.</description>

      <description>Ran across SwitchProxy for Firefox. Looks pretty cool. Basically you can set it up to download a list of open anonymous proxy servers, and hop between them at a specified interval (ie every minute it looks like you&amp;rsquo;re surfing from a different IP). Good deal for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s a little concerned about anonymity.</description>

      <description>So as of a few weeks ago, they finally got the parking deck close enough to &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; to open it. By &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo;, I mean the bulk of the structure is there, but they&amp;rsquo;re still actively working on it. Like putting in the sidewalks around it, putting in the street to the south, actually building up the 1st floor interior (where all the &amp;ldquo;retail&amp;rdquo; is supposed to go). Oh, and of course installing the elevators.</description>

To recap, I finally decided to break down and get myself something fun for getting my thesis deposited. Decided last week that I&amp;rsquo;d get myself a Canon Digital Rebel EOS-300D if I could find it at a price I liked. Ended up getting it at a pretty decent price ($200-250 off what I could get it for locally). Looks like it should be a pretty sweet camera ([Review, Another).</description>

      <description>Got two rants today. First off, what is up with FedEx? I bought something online that was shipped via 3-day FedEx. Estimated delivery is for tomorrow (to hit the 3-day deadline). Well, turns out they had it sitting in their local office this morning before they pack up the trucks for the day&amp;rsquo;s deliveries. But since I had only paid for 3-day, they decided to leave it sitting on the dock to be delivered tomorrow so that I&amp;rsquo;d know what I was missing out on by not going with 2-day.</description>

Think I&amp;rsquo;ll break down and pick up the first two seasons while I&amp;rsquo;m at it (only borrowed them from Richy previously). Probably need to go back and re-watch a bit of Season 2 to remember where things left off. Unfortunately, Season 4 won&amp;rsquo;t start until January. :(</description>

      <description>Spyware and Adware are really icky. At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m using a three-pronged approach:
Ad-Aware is designed to provide advanced protection from known Data-mining, aggressive advertising, Parasites, Scumware, selected traditional Trojans, Dialers, Malware, Browser hijackers, and tracking components. You fire it up and it scans your hard disk for nasty crap that has invited itself in. Been using this for a long time. Spybot Search &amp;amp; Destroy is pretty similar, but can catch some stuff that Ad-Aware misses (as Ad-Aware will catch some stuff that Spybot misses).</description>

For the moment, the old setup will continue to reside here, while the new version will reside here. This will be the last post to the old setup, to point people over to the new one. I figured while I was at it, I would revamp the style once again, since I was never 100% happy with the old one.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much luck getting the GNOME GTray app to work under Fedora. Dug around a little bit, and came up with a Firefox extension that largely does the trick (although you should probably just go to the front page and look for the newest version). Now I have to check my browser window to see if I&amp;rsquo;ve got new Gmail as opposed to simply looking at the GNOME system tray, but at least it works.</description>

      <description>So. Was driving along last week and heard a big pow from under the hood. Knew that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be good, and it continued to make awful sounds, so I immediately pulled over and called for a tow. Tow was pretty uneventful. Just a quick hop across town via the interstate. Went in to take care of the paperwork while the driver unloaded my car. Came back out to find the car still jacked up and with the hood popped up.</description>

      <description>Watched a little bit of the Speed network recently, and caught a documentary type show on Carroll Shelby. Basically, he&amp;rsquo;s responsible for the monster known as the Cobra (dropping a powerful Ford V-8 into a small/light AC body). Kicked some serious butt in racing for quite a while. After that, he&amp;rsquo;s done several additional iterations/refinements to the basic Cobra idea and worked with Ford on some more performance oriented versions of their Mustang and so forth.</description>

      <description>Who can forget the Happy Tree Friends when they&amp;rsquo;re talking about bizarre little WebToons? The series consists of a bunch of shorts of little cute fuzzy animals meeting their demise in a disturbing manner. Fun for the whole family. I also ran across this site that appeared to have all of the episodes available for convenient viewing (I don&amp;rsquo;t think the official site has all of the older ones). These toons have even come out on DVD if you can believe it (that&amp;rsquo;s how I first saw them).</description>

      <description>So apparently, MS is actually testing out Linux now before making their claims that Windows is better. The part I found most entertaining was a quote from a former IBM Linux supporter who&amp;rsquo;s been hired on at MS. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no set architecture in Linux. All roads lead to madness.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing Doom 3 off and on most of this week. If you like the Doom series, this is a welcome refresher. The graphics are pretty tight (although I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have a machine set up that&amp;rsquo;s fast enough to really crank it up beyond the lowest possible settings&amp;hellip; I do have most of the effects like bump mapping and stuff turned on though). Gameplay is pretty much what you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a Doom game, but I kinda like the combo of the dark environment and having to use a flashlight (which looks pretty damn good).</description>

Pretty entertaining show, and they sometimes have some cool bits on there. This past week they had a Best of: Free and Cheap episode detailing a number of free/cheap downloads and tips. I found a couple of segments of particular interest:
Linksys WRT54G - a lot of the Linksys network hardware runs Linux, and so they&amp;rsquo;ve had to release the source under GPL.</description>

Anyway, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait till Doom 3 hits shelves, hopefully tomorrow. Now I just have to wait for Half-Life 2, which looks awesome.</description>

      <description>This game looks to be pretty sweet. Another game in the stealth genre (ala Metal Gear), but the guy in this one wears a funky suit that lets him turn invisible when he crouches (somehow more believable than hiding in a little shadow). He can also emulate the appearance of any character he takes a picture of.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few of these around and been curious. Finally got around to looking into it, and it turns out Scion is a new subsidiary of Toyota. Basically, Toyota has realized that it may not have to coolest image with the youngfolk and wants to tap that market. They sorta tried with the Matrix, but I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly seen a slightly older crowd driving them (hi dad!). Guess they figured they needed a new car company to accomplish it.</description>

      <description>So earlier this week I noticed they had added an LED array display inside every bus. Reason I noticed this is because one of them was randomly displaying some info. Most of it was debugging stuff. What&amp;rsquo;s the version number of this unit, how much memory does it have, what time/day is it (which was totally wrong), etc. You get the idea. Occasionally, it would scroll street intersection info across the screen (like &amp;ldquo;PROSPECT AND KIRBY&amp;rdquo;).</description>

I was a little confused when I pulled the dead/flaky CDRW/DVD drive out of Amanda&amp;rsquo;s folk&amp;rsquo;s computer last week when it turned out to be a Philips instead of some no name manufacturer. Seemed a little odd that something they made would give out in a year and a half of normal use. Turns out it may be par for the course.</description>

      <description>So Amanda and I got back from our honeymoon in Ireland Monday night. We pretty much up and died when we got home. Very long day. Spent yesterday trying to get shifted back by 6 hours and deal with essential errands. We&amp;rsquo;ve had all of Amanda&amp;rsquo;s film developed onto CD, and I offloaded all of my digital pics to my computer. The photos are largely sorted by this point, but need some cleanup before I&amp;rsquo;ll put them up on the web.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering where on earth they came up with those brilliant, bizarre, singing critters. So freakin&amp;rsquo; hilarious. Anyway, the ads are done by this guy as demonstrated by this other webshort of his about the moon. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like everyone over at adland appreciates them though&amp;hellip; since they seem to have confused the little furry critters with rats which they don&amp;rsquo;t think are appropriate in food ads&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Looks like you actually can emulate a PPC on an x86 well enough to install OS X. It&amp;rsquo;s still a little on the slow side (basic emulation results in 500:1 slowdown over the host processor, while their JIT compiler for x86 brings that up to more like 40:1 slowdown since they cache the translated code), but the project seems pretty active, and there&amp;rsquo;s lots of room for improvement. Still pretty need to see Mac OS X running on a PC (either Windows or Linux, but I&amp;rsquo;ve just tried Linux at this point).</description>

      <description>I must be in one heck of a blogging mood today. I saw this Slashdot post and thought it sounded pretty sweet. Turns out, they&amp;rsquo;ve released a GPL&amp;rsquo;d PPC emulator for x86 that is actually capable of booting OS X. Here&amp;rsquo;s the OS-News article that includes all the pretty pictures. Sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s still got a few problems (reviewer ran into a few infinite loop explosions once OS X had started, and it guzzles the whole CPU), but it actually kinda worked.</description>

      <description>So Fedora Core 2 is officially out. I actually snagged it a few days early thanks to this Slashdot post that included this friendly torrent. Spent a while getting it up and running under VMware and it looked pretty good. Just when I starting to think about updating my RH9 box, the computer up and imploded on me. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what happened, but suddenly X refused to start and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get it to give me access to a text console so that I could back everything up and reinstall.</description>

      <description>So I was kinda curious what the story was behind the name for FC2 (Tettnang). Honestly, I was a little curious about FC1 (Yarrow), but never looked into it. Historically, Redhat has largely stuck with a naming convention where each release name relates to the immediate predecessor in some way, but not that predecessor&amp;rsquo;s predecessor (grandparent?). Anyway, this page at the Fedora site seems to cover it to some extent, and here&amp;rsquo;s a little more discussion on what some of those release names mean (and how they relate) (even more here).</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a silly little webpage I Richy clued me into. It supposedly predicts your ideal career based on your name (since it&amp;rsquo;s probably based on some sort of hash function or something, inclusion of middle and/or last name may improve your career path). For example:
Derek, Your ideal jobs is a Kids TV Presenter Derek Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a Bearded Lady in the circus. Derek Brendan Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a Office numpty.</description>

      <description>So recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching some webtoons done by Amy Winfrey (works as an animator for South Park), and they&amp;rsquo;re pretty cute. I started watching her current toon, Making Fiends, that revolves around two little girls, Vendetta and Charlotte, who go to school together. Vendetta makes all sorts of fiends and attempts to intimidate and destroy Charlotte, while Charlotte&amp;rsquo;s busy making friends. That led me to her previous set of toons, MuffinFilms, which are a variety of short animations involving muffins.</description>

      <description>So I finally have the remotest clue what the deal is with A4 paper (and as a result why the rest of the world feels the need to use it and screw up my print jobs, and make life difficult in LaTeX sometimes). Basically, there&amp;rsquo;s a slashdot post on it that points to this page that discusses some of the ideas behind why A4 is the size it is. Apparently all metric paper has a height-to-width ratio of the square root of 2.</description>

      <description>So I dug around for a bit, and ran across some pretty thorough coverage of the games at E3 over at GameSpot. All sorts of good stuff coming up. In the FPS category, you&amp;rsquo;ve got Doom 3, Half-Life 2, Halo 2 that all look pretty good. There&amp;rsquo;s the next Grand Theft Auto (San Andreas). The next Gran Turismo looks absolutely amazing. And they&amp;rsquo;ve got a little info on the upcoming Zelda game.</description>

      <description>Looks like the DI did actually send a photographer to the Evanescence concert&amp;hellip; they just never bothered to publish a story or any photos about it until now. Basically, they&amp;rsquo;ve got a feature on the DI Finest Photos of 2004 (little presumptuous seeing as the year&amp;rsquo;s not even half over). But apparently, they thought this photo of Evanescence was one of their best of the year. Why it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have warranted publishing earlier on that basis, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>

      <description>Well, it looks like Intel is finally going CMP (@ The Register and Reuters). They&amp;rsquo;re apparently going to address some of the issues associated with continuing to push for high performance with big monolithic superscalars (namely: power consumption associated with crazy-high clock frequencies, scaling limitations of centralized hardware structures, and the benefits of supporting higher throughput through parallelism instead of only relying on low-latency for sequential code). Pretty exciting if you&amp;rsquo;re a geek like me&amp;hellip; and would love a multiprocessor system.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting close to wrapping up this semester, which marks the end of my required course credits. All of the stuff for Nick&amp;rsquo;s class finished up yesterday afternoon. The slides for all of the project presentations are up at the ECE497NC website. We managed to slap together something for the poster session for Matt&amp;rsquo;s class this afternoon. Went ok, but since a large portion of the project is compiler stuff, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t the remotest clue about compilers in general so&amp;hellip; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t much help in fielding questions.</description>

      <description>Just ran across an interesting site. Appears to be a collection of oddball videos and such that have surfaced on the net. For example, there&amp;rsquo;s this vid of a kid going after a pi?ata, and news footage of a helicopter crash (always figured they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be pretty with those giant spinning blades). Note: definitely not work safe stuff here (there&amp;rsquo;s some non kid-friendly stuff there&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided the previous color scheme for Malkier was a little too bleak. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the whole black background thing for a bit too long (started way back in undergrad when everyone had plain grey backgrounds or awful background images and almost no one went black). Hopefully the new scheme is a little more festive&amp;hellip; although I&amp;rsquo;m not quite happy with it yet. And I finally got around to installing my own copy of my blog software (the old stuff was provided by the host and didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to customize the comments pages, or really control the blog as much as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked).</description>

      <description>So I borrowed some movies from Richy this past weekend (namely Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Batman, and Batman Returns). It reminded me just how good Jurassic Park was. Heck, I even used a quote from it in my high school yearbook (you ever look back at that sort of stuff and wonder what you were thinking&amp;hellip; all sorts of really meaningful/significant quotes you can put in there, and I put in something from a fairly silly hollywood flick).</description>

      <description>So I realized that IE and Mozilla parse CSS stuff differently. Apparently, Mozilla will interpret everything on a line after # as a comment (at least where appropriate) whereas IE seems to interpret it normally. As a result, my movie db looked absolutely awful in IE since I almost never use it. Anyway, now that I know, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken care of it. Should looke the same in IE and Mozilla now (at least it does for me in IE6).</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a good portion of the weekend working on getting wedding invites/response cards printed up on my old laser. Not to toot my own horn, but I think they turned out pretty cool. The font Amanda used (A Yummy Apology) went really well with her watercolor flowers and the deckled edges on the paper (scares me that I know what that means). Anyway, they&amp;rsquo;re pretty cool and should be spooling up to send them all out before much longer.</description>

      <description>So my movie database continues to evolve. I guess first I should mention what it does at this point. Basically, I feed movie title in, my script searches for it in the IMDB, presents the possible matches, and then fills in all the info from IMDB (title, year, genres, director, stars, etc). Then I can easily edit it as needed. Tonight I added some basic caching of the main page. In other words, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t doing any sort of special query (ie list everything), it will dump the webpage to a file and simply display that if it&amp;rsquo;s current, and only recreate it when the database has been updated.</description>

Nick&amp;rsquo;s teaching one on Unconventional Computer Architecture that&amp;rsquo;s been pretty interesting so far. Project&amp;rsquo;s coming along pretty well for that and most of my responsibilities have been finished.</description>

      <description>So Amanda and I (along with Richy, Carrie, Lee, and Dan) went to the Ben Folds concert last night at Foellinger. The show was great! The opening act was a great string trio led by David Berkeley on guitar, and assisted by Will Robertson on upright bass and Adam Buchwald(?) on mandolin. They were really good. I loved the mix of the 3 instruments. You should definitely check out David Berkeley if you get the chance (there&amp;rsquo;s a mp3 available for download on his page of a song &amp;ldquo;Fire Sign&amp;rdquo; that was featured in CBS&amp;rsquo; show Without a Trace).</description>

      <description>So early last week, I received the coolest thing from a guy at Altera. It&amp;rsquo;s called the Cubic Cyclonium, and it makes one heck of a paperweight. In essence, it&amp;rsquo;s a small system designed around an Altera Cyclone FPGA and includes a bunch of cool stuff (168 LED array, 1MB of SRAM, VGA out), all embedded in a block of clear Lexan plastic. It draws power over a USB cable, includes software to program it to do a variety of neat demos (defaults to displaying time and date, can display a scrolling marquee text message, stock quotes, and several games/screensavers including tetris, pong, life, etc).</description>

      <description>So I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve explicitly mentioned it, but I ended up renaming most of my machines a while back. I decided to switch to a theme as opposed to the random naming scheme I was using before (ie Malaise, Elysium, Nicosia, Sulaco, Aragorn, etc). At this point, most of my stuff is named after characters in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Hamlet. My aging Athlon box (Elysium) has been named after Polonius, the doddering old fool.</description>

      <description>So I saw Evanescence in concert this past Tuesday at the Assembly Hall. Great show.
First opening act, Atomship, was kinda eh. They weren&amp;rsquo;t awful, but they certainly weren&amp;rsquo;t very good either. Lead singer was pretty weird. Had something vaguely resembling a British accent until he mentioned they were from Mississippi when he suddenly reverted to a good ol&#39; boy accent. And he had this weird twitchy, seizurey sort of &amp;ldquo;dance&amp;rdquo; thing.</description>

I lost count, but I believe she rotated between 3 Fender electrics and some sort of acoustic during the course of the show with her roadie retuning between swaps. She claimed she had to swap out guitars a lot because he would have to retune depending on the song.</description>

      <description>Yeah, so things have been pretty busy the past several months, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t made any posts here since the fall semester started. Anyway, just wanted to pop on here to say I went to the Liz Phair concert last night and it rocked. Quite outstanding. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard her stuff, and like &amp;ldquo;chick rock&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest checking her out. Her most recent album is more pop than her older stuff.</description>

      <description>So State Farm, or at least the actuarial department, has a policy that co-workers do not bring in food to help you celebrate your birthday (or any other celebration-worthy event). That would be dumb since you end up having to bring in food frequently in a large department. State Farm&amp;rsquo;s solution: the person celebrating is expected to bring in food for the department in order to celebrate. That way, you only need to bring in food once a year (ie your own birthday).</description>

      <description>Well, since I&amp;rsquo;ve introduced Amanda&amp;rsquo;s co-worker Jane, I suppose I should actually start posting some of the more absurd stories about her. The first one that comes to mind I will entitle &amp;ldquo;Jane vs. UPS.&amp;rdquo;
One day, Jane got it into her head to send a marinated steak to a priest friend of hers in New Jersey. So she packaged up this piece of raw, marinated steak in a bowl surrounded by ice, and put this bowl in a box and taped it shut.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add a new category. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll title it &amp;ldquo;Tales of the Weird&amp;rdquo;, but for some reason I suspect simply &amp;ldquo;Jane Stories&amp;rdquo; would be more accurate. As such, I&amp;rsquo;ll start this category off with a brief introduction to Jane.
For those not in the know, Jane is one of Amanda&amp;rsquo;s co-workers over at State Farm corporate in Bloomington. Anyway, Jane is a weird little critter that should have been fired long ago, but somehow due to the ineptitude present in corporate America, continues to be paid to occupy space.</description>

      <description>Well, as you probably could have guessed by the lack of posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy this summer. Submitted a paper to HPCA (International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture for those not in the know). Crossing my fingers that it gets accepted because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working my ass off for it, and it would be cool for my work to appear in a big conference like HPCA, and hella cool to get to go to Madrid to present it.</description>

      <description>So I ran across this site (audioscrobbler.com) that seems kinda cool. The idea is you create an account, install a plugin for your favorite MP3 player software (be it Winamp, XMMS, SLIMP3, etc etc). This thing then aims to track your listening habits/preferences. In theory, after you&amp;rsquo;ve listened to enough (200 songs I think), it starts suggesting other artists based on your preferences and the preferences of other users who have similar interests.</description>

      <description>I saw an interesting bicycle while riding the bus today. It was one of those bicycles built for two. While those are unusual, I have never seen one quite like this. The front half of the bike was clearly designed for an adult rider, but the back half appeared to be intended for someone much shorter. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the back half is intended for a child or just someone of shorter than usual stature since it only had a full-sized rider up front when I saw it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add a new category to my blog&amp;hellip; I call it &amp;ldquo;On the bus.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a collection of experiences that I&amp;rsquo;ve had riding the bus to campus. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few experiences in the past week that seemed to warrant mention here, so I thought it seemed appropriate to add a new category for this type of rambling.</description>

      <description>Finished the final touches on my MSE paper and uploaded it to their server. I already faxed over the copyright form, so I should be good to go to head out to Anaheim in June. Pretty sweet. I&amp;rsquo;ve got postscript and pdf versions of the paper ready to go up on my work page whenever I decide it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to be publicly available.
The conference should prove interesting seeing as it falls smack between the abstract and paper deadlines for MICRO&amp;hellip; Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a position to worry about it at that point instead of still debugging the local data caches and getting more benchmarks up and running.</description>

Been looking around the net some, and it sounds like they&amp;rsquo;re slated to release the first season on DVD in April&amp;hellip; That would be pretty cool. Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that show in ages. Oh yeah, my test results for Sliders:</description>

To understand, usually in a global sense. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. Contrast zen, which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash. See also glark.
Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding. &amp;ldquo;Almost all C compilers grok the &amp;ldquo;void&amp;rdquo; type these days.</description>

You probably work in computers, or a history deptartment at a college. You never really fit in with the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; crowd. But you have friends, and this is a good thing.
I am 37% Internet Addict

      <description>Had an entertaining conversation with Jeff yesterday. Somehow we got on the topic of ECE291 and his team project. And how most of the rest of his team was pretty worthless. Anyway, he googled himself and showed me the webpage that the team made for their project. Turns out Gel (from IMSA) was on his team. So we started talking about her. So I guess Jeff was getting a little peeved by his team members and wasn&amp;rsquo;t convinced they were putting any effort into the project.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out what&amp;rsquo;s been troubling Elysium as of recent. After trying all sorts of stuff (updating my drivers, reinstalling the system from scratch several times, swapping out RAM, switching all partitions in the system over to NTFS&amp;hellip;), I finally noticed that the fan on the video card is dead. That would likely account for some of my problems (ie chunky video whenever I stress the video card by going to full screen or doing any 3d).</description>

Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too bad to get basic sequential circuit support added in and then I&amp;rsquo;ll have done both extra credit options. Mainly need to figure out how to time my program and the rest is trivial. Will probably look into doing some further optimizing of my code, but seems pretty zippy for any circuit I&amp;rsquo;ve run it on so far.</description>

I think I managed to succeed at being all sweet and romantical by surprising Amanda by making her lasagna from scratch with a side of garlic bread. Turned out pretty well considering I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really following any particular recipe. Also got her a copy of &amp;ldquo;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&amp;rdquo; and a set of cute dragonfly chopsticks from ArtMart. Oh, and of course a cute little card with a whole bunch of lady bugs that form a heart.</description>

Most of the references I have found on the web state that it&amp;rsquo;s a nonsense, made-up word. BJ&amp;rsquo;s convinced it&amp;rsquo;s legit, but I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s just a word his favorite author made up for one of his books. I could be wrong though. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask Amanda&amp;rsquo;s mom and see if she actually confirmed this word somewhere, or if BJ just showed it to her in one of his books.</description>

      <description>So my local data caches finally started doing stuff today. Cluster 0 requests M[0x0]. The main cache sends all words in that local cache line and informs cluster 0 that it has exclusive access. Cluster 1 then requests M[0x0]. The main cache informs Cluster 0 that the block is now shared and waits for an ACK to confirm that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t become modified. Pretty sweet! I may actually have it all up and running before much longer.</description>

So you end up actually getting a GC for $89. Hard to pass up, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t. Got a couple of games (Animal Crossing and Mario Party 4) along with a 2nd controller so at least Amanda and I can play togeter.</description>

      <description>Grr. Looks like the storm we had last night managed to screw up my DSL service. Analog voice is fine, but I can&amp;rsquo;t get my DSL modem to remain synched long enough to log in, let alone use it. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s been like that since some time around 2AM (according to my system logs, that&amp;rsquo;s when errors started showing up). Hopefully this&amp;rsquo;ll be resolved soon or I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be a very unhappy camper.</description>

For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at CRHC, we could get a slice of Papa Del&amp;rsquo;s on Fridays for a buck. The way this works is corporations give our professors all kinds of money for being cool. One excellent example is Professor Hwu&amp;rsquo;s IMPACT group (without which Intel wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made Itanium). Well, with the economy as it is, the corporate money isn&amp;rsquo;t flowing like it used to.</description>

      <description>So, it looks like 2003 might be the year of the geek. At least as far as movies go. We&amp;rsquo;ve got the Matrix sequels (Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions). We&amp;rsquo;ve got the final installment of the LOTR trilogy. We&amp;rsquo;ve got the third Harry Potter movie. And we&amp;rsquo;ve got a slew of Marvel comic movies coming out (The Hulk, X-Men 2, Daredevil). Lookin&amp;rsquo; pretty sweet if I do say so myself.</description>

      <description>A frequent, chronological publication of personal thoughts and Web links. [Source]
Background:
A blog is often a mixture of what is happening in a person&amp;rsquo;s life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people.
People maintained blogs long before the term was coined, but the trend gained momentum with the introduction of automated published systems, most notably Blogger at blogger.</description>

      <description>So Nick scheduled our first Amalgam meeting of the semester for today. But unfortunately, our meetings are scheduled for right before his class (which he has never taught before). As a result, he ditched our meeting to finish preparing his lecture. Nothing like getting things done early. Anyway, he dropped by around 1/2 hour before the meeting to tell Jeff and me that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming and we should figure out where the project will be around the end of the semester and what conferences we should shoot for.</description>

      <description>So Elysium seems to be having more trouble these days. Some games are pretty choppy, just plain refuse to load, etc. Can&amp;rsquo;t quite decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s a hardware or software issue. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wiped so that&amp;rsquo;s a possibility. Also seems there might be some issues with the drivers MS included with XP for my network card. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the quirks associated with my memory (populating all 3 DIMM slots may not be a Good Thing), and my so-called RAID card (random reboots when the drives get heavily accessed).</description>

      <description>Time to try out some things in this new weblog thingamadoo. Can I make links, such as this one to the UCA webpage? Or one to the Amalgam webpage?
More importantly, why am I up at this ungodly hour on a Saturday?</description>

      <description>So what all is new in my life at the moment:
Broke down and bought a Pioneer DVR-105 (4x DVD-R/2x DVD-RW) burner. Now if only I could get media for it&amp;hellip;
Been enjoying the Back to the Future trilogy on DVD. That DeLorean is SO COOL!
Oh, and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally started work again on AMALSIM. Just committed a whole boatload of changes into the repository. Mmmmm&amp;hellip; 64-bit cycle counts.</description>
