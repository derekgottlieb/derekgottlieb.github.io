I got an unexpected day off today.  Things were all hunky dorey this morning, but then around 11 something happened.  I'm not entirely clear on what.  Sounded like someone was doing some sort of maintenance work down in the basement, something went boom, and several fire sprinklers went off in the machine room.  Needless to say, the admins quickly shut everything down and went about cleaning up the mess, drying out all the computers and trying to get everything shifted over to another room.  Since all the network hardware, mail server, group file servers, etc were housed in that room, it was absolutely impossible for me to do any more work today.  Since I can't do anything there, I might as well go work on the house. :P
