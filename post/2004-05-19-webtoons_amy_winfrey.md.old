So recently I've been watching some webtoons done by Amy Winfrey (works as an animator for South Park), and they're pretty cute.  I started watching her current toon, [Making Fiends](http://makingfiends.com/), that revolves around two little girls, Vendetta and Charlotte, who go to school together.  Vendetta makes all sorts of fiends and attempts to intimidate and destroy Charlotte, while Charlotte's busy making friends.  That led me to her previous set of toons, [MuffinFilms](http://www.muffinfilms.com/), which are a variety of short animations involving muffins.  There's some real gems in there.  There's also [Big Bunny](http://www.big-bunny.com/), but I haven't gotten around to watching any of those yet.  My guess is... it's about a big bunny.
