Talked about this [earlier](/blog/2005/04/25/cardboard-sculpture).  Managed to take some more pictures today and actually load them onto my computer (as opposed to deleting them accidently again.  In addition to Optimus Prime, there were several milk carton people (only took a picture of one, but may go back for more later), a giant fork (didn't take a picture because I wasn't as enthralled by it, and it looked like it was slightly broken), a burning foosball player, and a really bizarre one involving a giant beetle pushing a dirt clod with a human fetus inside.  Go check out the [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/535934/)!
