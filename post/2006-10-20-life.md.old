So life has been pretty... something recently.  Too much going on and not quite enough sanity to go around.  Fortunately, I get to head out to San Jose this Sunday to visit with [Rich](http://www.thederivative.net) and Carrie... oh yeah and go to [ASPLOS](http://www.princeton.edu/~asplos06/) (Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems).  Looks like it should be an interesting conference and the best part is I don't have to foot the bill. :)

Kinda looking forward to getting away from the office for a bit, although I'll be bringing my work with me (must prelim soon!) and it means I'll be away from Amanda. :(  Perhaps if I can find a nice treat for her while I'm out there, all will be swell.
