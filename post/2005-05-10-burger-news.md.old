Amanda was telling me that the mayor of Detroit (who's apparently assisted in creating a 300 million dollar deficit) has proposed [an additional tax on fast-food](http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/09/news/economy/fastfood_tax/index.htm?cnn=yes) to help fill the city's coffers.  Guess this is a strategic move since Detroit's ranked third on the list of "fattest cities" (following Houston and Chicago)...

On a related note, I saw [this other article](http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/03/pf/biggest_burger/index.htm) at CNN about a restaurant that's started selling a 15-pound burger!  10 pounds of beef covered in a 17-inch bun, 25 slices of cheese, an entire head of lettuce, 3 tomatoes, 2 onions, not to mention the usual condiments.  Pretty disturbing.  At least apparently they don't expect one person to finish it alone... if two people manage to eat it within a 3 hour sitting, they get the $30 burger for free!
