According to BJ, a glibbet is a small, weasel-like animal.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to confirm this is a legit word.  Most of the references I have found on the web state that it's a nonsense, made-up word.  BJ's convinced it's legit, but I suspect it's just a word his favorite author made up for one of his books.  I could be wrong though.  I'll have to ask Amanda's mom and see if she actually confirmed this word somewhere, or if BJ just showed it to her in one of his books.
