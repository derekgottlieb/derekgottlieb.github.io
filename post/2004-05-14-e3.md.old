So I dug around for a bit, and ran across some pretty thorough coverage of the games at E3 over at [GameSpot](http://www.gamespot.com/e3/index.html).  All sorts of good stuff coming up.  In the FPS category, you've got [Doom 3](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/doom3/), [Half-Life 2](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/), [Halo 2](http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/halo2/) that all look pretty good.  There's the next Grand Theft Auto ([San Andreas](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/)).  The next [Gran Turismo](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/granturismo4/) looks absolutely amazing.  And they've got a little info on the upcoming [Zelda](http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/thelegendofzelda/) game.
