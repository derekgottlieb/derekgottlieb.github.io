I know this was posted last week on [slashdot](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/03/1738213&tid=143&tid=163&tid=223&tid=106), but it looks like the website for [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) finally went live.  Pretty exciting stuff.  First RedHat split their distro into a commercial, "enterprise" class distro and the bleeding-edge, completely open distro [Fedora](http://fedora.redhat.com/) (open in the sense that more than just RedHat employees were actively contributing to its development and direction).  Now Novell has opened up SUSE.  If I remember correctly, it used to be an exclusively commercial distro if I remember correctly... wasn't available for free download.  Good stuff.  I know they'd opened up some of their management tools (YAST for example), but it's nice to see the whole thing opened up.  Might have to go check it out...
