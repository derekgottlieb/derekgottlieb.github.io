Took some tests at [Fuali.com](http://www.fuali.com/).  Here are my results:  
  







I am 29% Geek

You probably work in computers, or a history deptartment at a college.  You never really fit in with the "normal" crowd. But you have friends, and this is a good thing.


  
  







I am 37% Internet Addict

I could go either way.  Deep into the madness of nights filled with coding CGI-Scripts and online role playing games, or I could become a normal user.  Good luck!


  
  







I am 51% Evil Genius

Evil courses through my blood.  Lies and deceit motivate my evil deeds.  Crushing the weaklings and idiots that do nothing but interfere in my doings.


  
  


I'm not sure how much faith I have in the testing criteria, but at least I'm not as much of a geek or an net junkie as I may have suspected.  My rating on the Evil Genius scale is a little frightening though.  Guess that's just my intellectual elitism showing through...
