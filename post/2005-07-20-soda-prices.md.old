Was just down to the basement in CSL to buy a soda only to find they've jacked the 20oz price up to $1.25.  Lame.  They don't provide us with free espresso-based beverages, they don't provide us with a convenient places to buy espresso-based beverages, and now they're mugging us on the sodas.  How are grad students supposed to work into the wee hours without a cheap source of caffeine? :(  Might have to just start bringing my own.
