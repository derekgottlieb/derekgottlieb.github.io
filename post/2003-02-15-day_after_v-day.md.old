So, yesterday was Valentine's Day.  I think I managed to succeed at being all sweet and romantical by surprising Amanda by making her lasagna from scratch with a side of garlic bread.  Turned out pretty well considering I wasn't really following any particular recipe.  Also got her a copy of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and a set of cute dragonfly chopsticks from ArtMart.  Oh, and of course a cute little card with a whole bunch of lady bugs that form a heart.  Pretty good day overall despite the icky weather that moved in last night.
