Three years ago yesterday, Amanda and I were married in the walled garden in Allerton Park.  To celebrate, I made dinner and dessert (many thanks to Giada De Laurentiis of Food Network's Everyday Italian for the tastyness):





  * [Fiery Angel Hair Pasta](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_28334,00.html?rsrc=search) (added some chicken cooked in some of the chili oil)


  * [Raspberry Cream Cupcakes](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_29942,00.html) (decided to do a combo of raspberries and strawberries)
