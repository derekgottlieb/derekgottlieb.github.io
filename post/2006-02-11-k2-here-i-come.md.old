Part way through switching over to K2.  Looks like I need to fine tune the custom page themes I've previously created (for [movies](/movies) and [header_graphics](http://malkier.com/header_graphics.php)).  They work at present, but the two column setup isn't really formatted right under the new theme.

I also want to set up a new header graphic, probably tweak the color scheme, and maybe look into some other cool options/extensions (such as embedding a flickr feed in the sidebar).
