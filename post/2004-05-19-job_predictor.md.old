[Here's](http://http://www.jobpredictor.com/) a silly little webpage I [Richy](http://thederivative.net) clued me into.  It supposedly predicts your _ideal_ career based on your name (since it's probably based on some sort of hash function or something, inclusion of middle and/or last name may improve your career path).  For example:  



  


  * Derek, Your ideal jobs is a Kids TV Presenter
  


  * Derek Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a Bearded Lady in the circus.
  


  * Derek Brendan Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a Office numpty.
  


  * Derek Brendan, Your ideal job is a Brain Surgeon.
  


  * Gottlieb, Your ideal job is a As the Speaking Clock.
  

  

It would appear that renouncing my last name is the key to a good career.  Don't even get me started on what sort of stuff it predicts for Amanda... especially after she marries me.
