So, I've finally gotten around to working on a custom header image for my blog.  Not sure that I'm quite happy with it yet, but I like the feel of it better than the default that came with [Kubrick](http://www.binarybonsai.com/kubrick/).  One of the flowers Amanda painted for our wedding invitations was the inspiration... but I think it may be a bit too girly.  Will have to see what I think after a bit more time.
