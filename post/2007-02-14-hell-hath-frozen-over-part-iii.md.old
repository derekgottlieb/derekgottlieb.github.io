Apparently the UofI hasn't called a snow day since '79.  That's close to 30 years of no snow days.  They had some silly spokesperson on the news last night that tried to claim we were such a hardy campus and liked to walk everywhere so it took an awful lot to shut us down.  Apparently they decided that severe blizzard conditions with 45mph gusts and snow falling way faster than the plows could ever hope to keep up with might actually warrant a snow day.  Something about it just not being safe to walk around campus...  Bloody brilliant!
