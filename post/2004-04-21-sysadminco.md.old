So every so often I'll read through some of the stuff at [SysadminCo](http://www.sysadminco.com/).  It's a collection of stupid user questions and such send to the sysadmins at some ISP.  They have some entertaining stuff sometimes, and have an amusing shell-like interface.  Anyway, as I was skimming a bit today, I ran across this [one techism](http://www.sysadminco.com/techisms.php?techism_id=123) that I got a kick out of.
