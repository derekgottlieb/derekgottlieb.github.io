Finally bit the bullet and ordered myself a Mac mini.  There's a good 3-4 week lead time on them currently, so I still have time to back out if I get cold feet.  But I've been wanting a machine that'd run OS X for some time now.  Every so often I look into "cheap" used Macs on fleabay, but have always been thwarted by the remarkably high prices that old Macs go for.  Fairly ancient G4's (350MHz, 128MB RAM, Rage 128 video, 20GB HDD) were going for $300 or more.  Seems like if I'm gonna give it a shot, a brand new mini would give me a whole lot more bang for not too much more buck.  And it would be tiny to boot!
