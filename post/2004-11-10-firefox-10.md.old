Firefox made it's [1.0 release yesterday](http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-11-09.html).  If you haven't tried this attractive alternative to IE, go do so now!  It's substantially faster than old Mozilla/Netscape, standards compliant (unlike IE), less likely to allow your machine to be filled with spyware (unlike IE), has all sorts of cool extensions to add additional functionality (even redefine existing functionality)... oh and it won't give you the plague either (unlike IE)! ;)  It's just dripping in plague juice!  I bet it's lymph nodes are as big as cats!
