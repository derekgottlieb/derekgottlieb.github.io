TV on DVD is so very cool.  After a recommendation from Lee (not to mention my own curiosity), I rented the first disc of Joss Whedon's _Firefly_ a few weeks back.  Really enjoyed it, so I ended up buying it.  Good stuff.

Sticking with the trend, I decided to go rent the first couple of discs for BBC's _MI-5_.  It had piqued my interest previously, but hadn't gotten around to looking for it until the recent issue of _Wired_ reminded me.  (The Wired/Tired/Expired segment included it as MI-5/Alias/24.)  Been enjoying it so far.  A bit complicated at times, so I'm guessing I may have to go back and watch some of these episodes again.  Anthony Stewart Head (from _Buffy_ fame) even appears in one of the eps.
