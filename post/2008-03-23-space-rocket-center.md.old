Finally caught up with going through my photos and uploading to Flickr.  Katie was in town visiting this past week (Spring Break).  Aside from the holy week activities (choir tired now), one afternoon Amanda and I took off work and all three of us went to the Space & Rocket Center.  Lots of interesting historical NASA stuff (early V-2 rockets, Saturn V/Apollo stuff, etc), but I have to admit some of it felt a bit slapped together.  Amanda's description of the presentation in the new Saturn V building: "high school science project... factually accurate, but looked like it was printed up on the parents' inkjet printer and put in a cheesy plastic picture frame."  Since they only opened that recently, I can only assume it was a rush job and they'll hopefully gloss it up a bit as time goes on.

The older part of the museum could definitely use a revamp though.  Didn't seem to be organized in a way that someone without a fair bit of previous rocket/NASA knowledge would get much out of it.  Felt like what you'd get when you ask a bunch of scientists to design a museum.  Again, factually correct, but rather dry and lacking the polish you'd hope for in a museum that was aiming to appeal to the general public.  The multimedia parts felt really dated.  While they'd spent the bucks on upgrading to nice fancy plasma TVs, they were still obviously playing videos produces back in the '80s that were being played back on VHS tapes that dated back to the same time period.  Ignoring the crappiness of '80s production values, the audio and video quality were pretty lousy to the point where you were glad they had the closed captions turned on everywhere so you had some idea what they were actually saying.  I distinctly remember one video that had some cheesy '80s music that sounded like a bunch of kids singing at the bottom of a well...
