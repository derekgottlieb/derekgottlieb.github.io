Yeah, so they've bumped up the price of pizza at work.  For as long as I've been working at CRHC, we could get a slice of Papa Del's on Fridays for a buck.  The way this works is corporations give our professors all kinds of money for being cool.  One excellent example is Professor Hwu's [IMPACT](http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/IMPACT/) group (without which Intel wouldn't have made Itanium).  Well, with the economy as it is, the corporate money isn't flowing like it used to.  As a result, Prof's aren't putting in as much money as they used to, and so they've doubled the price of pizza. :(
