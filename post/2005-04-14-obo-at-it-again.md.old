Looks like the Orange and Blue Observer (OBO) are at it again.  When I went to drop off my Rentertainment DVDs today, I couldn't help but notice the sidewalk chalk ads everywhere for a 9mm raffle being held today on the Quad.  Guess their [AK-47 raffle](/blog/2005/03/30/ak-47-raffle) went well enough that they decided to make some more money (and presumably make some sort of statement at the same time).
