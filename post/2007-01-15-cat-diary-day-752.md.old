Day 752 of my captivity.  Found what I hope is one of my captor's favorite possessions.  It appears to be some sort of container for transporting instruments of my exploitation and I believe it to be associated with their obnoxious light flashing device.

I have thoroughly inspected it's contents to ascertain if it might hold anything I could use in my escape.  Having found nothing, I destroyed it's lining with my claws and ate the outer edges to prevent its further use.
