Ok.  So I was poking around Gamestop, and ran across [this](http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=880743).  Can you believe it?  For those of you who just couldn't get enough leather, a leather computer mouse?

Anyway, I can't wait till [Doom 3](http://games.slashdot.org/games/04/07/31/1114246.shtml?tid=204) hits shelves, hopefully tomorrow.  Now I just have to wait for Half-Life 2, which looks awesome.
