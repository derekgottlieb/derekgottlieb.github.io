                    <p>So I&rsquo;ve been going nuts working on class projects this semester.  I&rsquo;m trying to
wrap up the last of my class work and am currently taking a couple of ECE497
courses (special topics grad courses where professors largely discuss their own
research interests).</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s teaching one on <a href="http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/ece497nc/">Unconventional Computer
Architecture</a> that&rsquo;s been pretty
interesting so far.  Project&rsquo;s coming along pretty well for that and most of my
responsibilities have been finished.  We&rsquo;re doing hyperblock formation (in
SUIF) supplemented by path profiling (in amalsim) combined with a basic
run-time reconfiguration simulator that should estimate performance benefits of
swapping hyperblocks out to reconfigurable logic.  I wrote up the path profiler
stuff which has all been checked in and barring any more surprises in SUIF,
should be good to go.</p>
<p>Matt Frank (of <a href="http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/raw/">RAW</a> fame) is teaching one on
<a href="http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece497/mf/">Multi-threaded Computer Architecture</a>.
It&rsquo;s been really good.  Sort of a good overview of how parallelizing compilers
work, how the corresponding hardware works, without getting into really icky
details (like CS426).  The project is a big question mark at this point.  We&rsquo;re
attempting to make the GSA-PDG actually work for real programs (lookin' pretty
scary), then somehow resequentializing it after we&rsquo;ve got it, and of course do
some simulations on it for some basic limit study sort of thing.  I&rsquo;ve just
wrapped up my first pass at a simulator.  It&rsquo;s mostly there at this point
(reads in Jeff&rsquo;s GSA description, generates the internal graph representation,
and then does some of the functional simulation of that graph in an
event-driven logic simulator sense).  I don&rsquo;t have all the operations supported
at this point&hellip; like I&rsquo;m not sure what a CVT is, I have no idea how the memory
operations should realistically work, and have absolutely no feel for what&rsquo;s
going on with the GSA-specific nodes.  If I dig out the GSA papers again, I
might stand a chance at those, but since I&rsquo;m working with a moving target at
this point, I&rsquo;m not going to work too much more on it until I see what Brian
and Jeff have been up to&hellip;</p>
