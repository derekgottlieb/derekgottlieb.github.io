                    <p>So I&rsquo;ve seen a few of these around and been curious.  Finally got around to
looking into it, and it turns out <a href="http://www.scion.com/">Scion</a> is a new
subsidiary of Toyota.  Basically, Toyota has realized that it may not have to
coolest image with the youngfolk and wants to tap that market.  They sorta
tried with the Matrix, but I&rsquo;ve mainly seen a slightly older crowd driving them
(hi dad!).  Guess they figured they needed a new car company to accomplish it.
There basically still Toyotas, so you get the same kind of reliability you
would from one with their logo on the hood.  They&rsquo;ve also taken cues from
Saturn and apparently have gone with the no-hassle approach to sales (here&rsquo;s
the price and that&rsquo;s that).  Looks like they&rsquo;ve got a total of 3 models at this
point, and options are largely limited to &ldquo;do you want stick or an automatic?&rdquo;
But that&rsquo;s because just about everything you&rsquo;d actually want in a car is
included in the base price.  The most humorous part of it all is the fact that
they have all sorts of appearance add-ons that you can get including &ldquo;sport&rdquo;
mufflers, logoed oil cap s and battery tie downs, LED mood lighting inside the
vehicle, etc.  Guess they&rsquo;re shooting for the ricer who&rsquo;d like to get it all
direct from the factory.</p>
