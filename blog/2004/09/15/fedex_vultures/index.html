                    <p>Got two rants today.  First off, what is up with FedEx?  I bought something
online that was shipped via 3-day FedEx.  Estimated delivery is for tomorrow
(to hit the 3-day deadline).  Well, turns out they had it sitting in their
local office this morning before they pack up the trucks for the day&rsquo;s
deliveries.  But since I had only paid for 3-day, they decided to leave it
sitting on the dock to be delivered tomorrow so that I&rsquo;d know what I was
missing out on by not going with 2-day.  Meanies.</p>
<p>And the vultures at Zorba&rsquo;s were really pissing me off yesterday.  I&rsquo;m not
talking about the staff (they&rsquo;ve typically been great).  I&rsquo;m talking about the
other customers.  Jeff and I are sitting there trying to have lunch and this
guy walks up, puts his bag and stuff in an empty seat at our table and asks if
it&rsquo;d be ok if he put his stuff down there.  Ok, weird, but whatever.  Then like
5-10 minutes later he gets his food and is like &ldquo;mind if I join you guys.&rdquo;
Can&rsquo;t he see we&rsquo;re trying to have a conversation.  How rude.  Fortunately the
people at the table behind me just happened to be leaving at that moment, so
they offered it to him and he took it.  Get this.  A lady standing near our
table waiting for her food (and nosily observing this exchange) proceeds to
butt into our conversation with &ldquo;you ARE leaving soon, right?  not that you&rsquo;re
not welcome here&hellip;&rdquo;  Yeah.  Not that we&rsquo;re not welcome, but please get out now
so she can sit there.  How rude.  Like the Seinfeld addendum &ldquo;not that there&rsquo;s
anything wrong with that.&rdquo;  Why won&rsquo;t all of these people just piss off and let
us enjoy our lunch in peace and go find another table.  Or get their food to go
and sit on the quad if they&rsquo;re so concerned about where they&rsquo;re going to sit.</p>
