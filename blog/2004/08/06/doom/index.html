                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>So I&rsquo;ve been playing Doom 3 off and on most of this week.  If you like the Doom
series, this is a welcome refresher.  The graphics are pretty tight (although I
don&rsquo;t actually have a machine set up that&rsquo;s fast enough to really crank it up
beyond the lowest possible settings&hellip; I do have most of the effects like bump
mapping and stuff turned on though).  Gameplay is pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect
from a Doom game, but I kinda like the combo of the dark environment and having
to use a flashlight (which looks pretty damn good).  Of course, they like to
pounce on you sometimes in really dark areas, which kinda sucks.  Can&rsquo;t really
see without the flashlight, and you have to drop that to use a weapon (guess
they haven&rsquo;t seen how the SWAT guys have little flashlights attached to their
shotguns).  I guess sometimes you can see the enemy by noticing their glowing
eyes, but I&rsquo;m not sure they all glow.  I kinda like the PDA system too (you
pick up other people&rsquo;s PDA and sync up to read their email, hear audio logs,
and sometimes get codes for storage lockers).</p>
<p>I wish they&rsquo;d done a more advanced damage model ala Soldier of Fortune.  I
shoot a zombie in the arm, he flinches in that direction and usually gets a red
spot there, but it would be cool if I could blow off limbs and have them keep
coming as appropriate.  You do get to catch a glimpse of a brain now and then
as you blow apart a zombie&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you like the old Doom, and enjoy simply running around shooting the
crap out of things, you might give it a look.  Story&rsquo;s nothing all that
amazing.  Really, I wish I could fight more zombies.  Seems like someone could
pretty easily come up with a mod for the Night of the Living Dead series or
something.</p>
