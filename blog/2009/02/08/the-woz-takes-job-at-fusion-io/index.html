                    <p>So this story has been all over the place (at least if you read computing/HPC
news).  Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer and designer of the
historically significant Apple I and Apple II, took a job as chief scientist at
a startup I was already aware of, <a href="http://www.fusionio.com/">Fusion-io</a>.
They&rsquo;ve been designing PCIe boards loaded with flash memory to deliver super
high performance storage to servers and maybe high-end gamers.  In theory it&rsquo;s
using similar technology to SSDs, but they&rsquo;re able to achieve significantly
higher bandwidth and IOPs than has been achieved in an SSD that is focused on
stuffing flash into a conventional SATA hard drive form factor.  This isn&rsquo;t the
first time companies have tried using flash memory as a hard disk for HPC (Dave
would remind me that one of the old Crays had a sea of flash memory intended
for this purpose), but flash densities are finally getting high enough to put a
useful amount of storage in a machine (as opposed to just using it to speed up
your swap file/virtual memory).</p>
<p>What makes this particularly interesting to me is that John (buddy from UR and
best man at my wedding) is chief hardware architect at Fusion-io.  Hopefully
this announcement, combined with their deals with some of the major
manufacturers (Dell, HP, IBM) solidifies their company in the storage arena.  I
really think they have a cool product that sets them apart from everyone else
trying to use flash memory in servers.</p>
