                    <p>Well this is certainly not something I expected.  SGI is one of the few HPC
vendors out there that I&rsquo;m aware of who are still doing neat things with
hardware.  We&rsquo;ve got some of their large SMP Itanium boxes on the floor where I
work, and I think they&rsquo;re pretty slick machines.  Pricy, but slick.  And so far
their support is about the best I&rsquo;ve dealt with.  That&rsquo;s not saying their
perfect (try getting a CXFS guru on the phone when you need one without sitting
on a major outage for several hours), but they generally seem better than most
of the other HPC vendors I&rsquo;ve worked with (IBM, Cray).  But SGI&rsquo;s certainly had
its share of financial woes and I think there was a recent warning from NASDAC
that they&rsquo;d be delisted.  So I&rsquo;m not necessarily surprised that someone&rsquo;s
buying them out, but that it&rsquo;s Rackable specifically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had real day-to-day experience with a Rackable system, but they
seemed to work at the other extreme of value commodity systems.  I&rsquo;ve chatted
with some of their sales/technical folks and they push their cluster in a cargo
container idea pretty hard.  Their distinguishing features seem to be power
distribution (aiming at higher efficiency by doing a single AC -&gt; DC conversion
and distributing DC to all the servers in a rack), and cooling efficiency (half
depth servers loaded from both sides of a rack and blasting hot air into the
gab between them in the middle of the rack).  These are certainly aimed at
addressing some of the big issues in datacenters everyone&rsquo;s facing (power &amp;
cooling), but a lot of the big vendors are attacking those same problems, so I
couldn&rsquo;t guess whether Rackable really stands out in the commodity cluster
space.  But I suppose if they&rsquo;ve got VC cash lying around, buying up the
engineering assets at SGI may go a long ways toward giving them some more
unusual products to set them apart.</p>
<p>I have to admit there&rsquo;s a small part of me that thinks today was not the best
day for them to announce the acquisition given the history of April 1st online
shenanigans everyone&rsquo;s expecting.</p>
