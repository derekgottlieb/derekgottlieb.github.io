                    <p>Rachel and her roommate Tammy (who&rsquo;s a hoot btw) came down Friday night to
catch the show at the Canopy Club featuring <a href="http://www.thelivingblue.com/">The Living
Blue</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thetractorkings">Tractor
Kings</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/darkcountry">Dark
Country</a>, and <a href="http://endtimesculture.com/chaos/">The
Dolphin</a>.  We showed up some time during the
Dolphin&rsquo;s set and all I have to say is weird.  I couldn&rsquo;t really tell whether
they were playing something or just getting setup and making random noises
on-stage.  We elected to wait out at the bar until after their set was over.</p>
<p>Thought Dark Country put on a pretty good show, but I would&rsquo;ve liked to hear a
bit more (they were only able to play a handful of songs).  Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get
to hear more from them in the future&hellip; perhaps an EP?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I think of the Tractor Kings.  I will definitely say I
was impressed to see one of them playing a 12 string acoustic guitar as a part
of their act.  I might have to check out more of their stuff to see what I
think.  Seemed like fairly subdued music compared to the other acts, but maybe
that&rsquo;s just me.  Guess I should also check out the old 57s (er, I think that&rsquo;s
what Tammy said they reminded her of&hellip; not sure since it was kinda loud in
there).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the Living Blue previously, and they fit with what I&rsquo;d remembered.
Clearly most of the people there on Friday night had come to see them play as
they swarmed around the stage when they got started.  I will say I thought
their show I caught at Cowboy Monkey was more entertaining (perhaps because it
was a more intimate venue and the place was comfortably packed).</p>
<p>Good stuff overall.  Was kinda fun getting to hang out with Rachel and Tammy in
their natural habitat so to speak.</p>
<p>&lt;rant&gt;</p>
<p>Although a lot of their associates clearly don&rsquo;t think very highly of CU&hellip;
sort of reminded me of all the Chicago Bears fans who had the nerve to come
down and ruin our poor little town for a weekend (several times over the course
of a season while the Bears were playing at our stadium while theirs was under
repairs/construction) and then to have the nerve to complain about everything
(there&rsquo;s too much traffic&hellip; well duh you guys were the traffic, it smells
bad&hellip; well duh you&rsquo;re in farm country, etc etc).</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
