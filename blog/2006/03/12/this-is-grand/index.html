                    <p>Lee and I trekked up to Chicago to catch The New Pornographers / Belle &amp;
Sebastian play at the Riviera Friday night.</p>
<p>I handled travel plans (directions to the Park&amp;Ride; station where we parked
and caught the &ldquo;L&rdquo;, trains to take, transfers to make, how to get to the
theater, last train we&rsquo;d have to catch). Pretty uneventful trip for the most
part. The most interesting part was how the bike lane to the side of the road
in Chicago was used as a thug passing lane by many. Successfully made it to
the P&amp;R; without wrecking and caught the Green line to Roosevelt. Accidently
transferred to the Orange line instead of the Red (Red was subway while
Green/Orange are both elevated), but fortunately caught the one headed toward
the Loop instead of to Midway. Rode around the loop till State/Lake where we
could transfer to the Red. The Loop itself was kind of an interesting
experience. The train moves slow enough (with all the frequent tight turns)
that you get a good look at downtown from up there. Made our way on up to
Lawrence and caught sight of the theater from the train. Roamed around a bit
until we found Gigio&rsquo;s that served up some tasty thin crust pizza (little
slightly scuzzy hole in the wall type joint I&rsquo;d read good reviews about after
doing a quick net search for restaurants in the area).  Excellent show. The
Riviera was an interesting venue. Had a very &ldquo;old opera house&rdquo; sort of
vibe. Largely general admission with room for a decent size crowd standing on
the ground floor by the stage and a fair sized balcony above. Very clearly
supported by Miller Lite since there were at least six bars on the main floor
(a few more out in the hallway, as well as in the hallways on the upper
levels). Was definitely wanting for personal space by the time B&amp;S; got on
the stage though. Had a reasonable amount of space when TNP were up, but
after their set, people slowly forced their way up by the stage until I didn&rsquo;t
have room to move my arms from my sides&hellip; and I got to know one guy&rsquo;s leather
pants covered ass a whole lot better than I would&rsquo;ve liked. :)</p>
<p>Managed to get our transfer right on the way back, but the &ldquo;L&rdquo; experience was
definitely a bit more colorful on the way back than it had been earlier&hellip; A
fellow hopped on with his wife and sat by us. Sat smack in the middle of the
two seats with his bag to his left. As she tried to sit next to him he
hollered at her &ldquo;Owww, yo sittin on me woman!&rdquo; (or something of that general
nature). Then he went on to spout an assortment of angry drivel while she
listened in silence. This made more sense after he pulled out a couple of
brown paper sacks, took a swig from something with a screwcap that smelled like
cheap whiskey and then integrated this into the bottle of gatorade he had in
the other sack. A little later on, there was a young fellow that didn&rsquo;t felt
like switching cars (which was a fairly common pasttime of the younger crowd,
but this fellow rode for quite a while in the gap between the cars). Oh, and
when we got off at our stop I noticed some hair extensions someone had left in
one of the seats&hellip;  Oh, and the title of the post. One of the stops is at
Grand, and we found the train announcement rather amusing at the time (a very
subdued &ldquo;This is Grand&rdquo;). Of course, I also found the end of the line
announcement &ldquo;This is as far as this train goes&rdquo; somewhat amusing as well.</p>
