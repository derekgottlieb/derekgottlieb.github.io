                    <p>Finally got to see <a href="http://www.reputationmusic.com">The Reputation</a> live&hellip; and
they rocked!  Went to see them last night with Lee at <a href="http://www.cowboy-monkey.com/">Cowboy
Monkey</a> here in CU and they were fantastic.
Great show.  Can&rsquo;t beat the price either.  $8 cover for 3 bands playing a 45
minute set each.  And Lee and I were right up there by the stage.  Couldn&rsquo;t get
much closer without completely losing my hearing. :)  A good time was
definitely had by all.</p>
<p>The Rep led the night with a bunch of my favorites from their two albums, and
at least one track they&rsquo;re working on for a new album.  Excellent stuff!  They
were followed up by <a href="http://www.dressybessy.com">Dressy Bessy</a> which left me
quite favorably impressed.  They put on a great show and I&rsquo;ll have to check out
more of their stuff.  <a href="http://www.thelivingblue.com/">The Living Blue</a>
(formerly The Blackouts) brought the night to a close and put on quite a
show&hellip; just not quite as much my taste as The Rep and Dressy Bessy.</p>
<p>And to continue my quest for meeting <a href="/blog/2005/07/25/cu-music-parasol-and-angie">cool indie music
folk</a>, I met the members of The
Rep.  Nice bunch.  Kinda wild to think Elizabeth Elmore&rsquo;s a lawyer when she&rsquo;s
not doing the whole band thing.  Their new bass player seems like a pretty good
match too.  Keeping my eye out for next time their in town.  Oh, and if you get
the chance you might check out the sample tracks they&rsquo;ve got up on their
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/thereputation">Myspace</a>&hellip; including a new demo track.</p>
