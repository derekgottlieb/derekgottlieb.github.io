                    <p>Caught <a href="http://www.andrewbird.net">Andrew Bird</a> last night with Lee at the
Canopy Club.  Impressive live show.  I was really amazed how much can come out
of so few people.  If you&rsquo;ve never heard Andrew Bird, his music has lots going
on.  Very melodic.  The show (and presumably his album too) was performed by
two people using slick audio equipment.  They&rsquo;d play several measures on one
instrument, loop it, then play along to it with other stuff.  Bird plays the
violin, an electric guitar, sings all the vocals, whistles (reminiscent of the
little bird Woodstock accompanying the girl in the ice skating competition in
one of those old Peanuts tv specials if you know what I&rsquo;m talking about&hellip;),
and occasionally kicks out a few accent notes on a small xylophone.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by <a href="http://www.doshfamily.com">Martin Dosh</a> who played
keyboards and drums in a similar manner.  Dosh played a couple of
&ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; tracks as one of the opening acts immediately preceding Bird&rsquo;s
performance.  Could swear I&rsquo;ve heard his tune &ldquo;Sam the Cat&rdquo; somewhere
previously&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.haleybonar.com/">Haley Bonar</a> got things started with some acoustic
guitar/keyboard tracks sometimes backed up by a guy on an electric bass.
Beautiful voice.  Reminded me a bit of early Jewel (the more
thoughtful/sorrowful tracks as opposed to the peppier ones&hellip; before she went
and tried to go all trashy mainstream pop).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the crowd was largely composed of rude undergrads (the Canopy&rsquo;s
real close to the Quad) who couldn&rsquo;t stop chatting during the first couple of
performances (especially bad during the first act).  Felt kinda bad for her
having to perform in front of a reasonably large crowd, at least 2/3rds of
which couldn&rsquo;t care less that she was up there.  No accounting for the bad
taste of rude people I guess.</p>
