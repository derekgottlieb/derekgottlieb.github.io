                    <p>Apparently it&rsquo;s been a busy week for my flickr photos.  I&rsquo;ve had two that were
selected for inclusion in various web things.</p>
<p>First, one of my Ireland honeymoon photos was selected for inclusion in Schmap
Dublin Third Edition (check out <a href="http://www.schmap.com/dublin/tours_tour1/p=2607/i=2607_10.jpg">Literary Dublin: Trinity
College</a>).
Oddly enough, it was a photo I took while we were wandering around Trinity
College.  Here&rsquo;s a little descriptive blurb from their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exploring a Schmap Guide is a uniquely interactive experience: maps and guide
content are dynamically integrated, allowing intuitive, real-time access to
reviews and photo slideshows for places of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, one of my photos from Hong Kong was selected for use in a Wikipedia
article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law_Article_23">Hong Kong Basic Law Article
23</a>.  It&rsquo;s a
picture I took from a trolley of a huge demonstration protest against &ldquo;Article
23&rdquo;.  For the longest time I&rsquo;d wondered what the heck Article 23 was about and
why it was so unpopular.  Jeff and I had asked the guy who was showing us
around but he didn&rsquo;t seem to know.  Best guess was it had something to do with
encroaching communism since the UK&rsquo;s rental agreement was about up on HK, and
so the PRC was working on stepping in.  From the Wikipedia entry, it sounds
like an unsurprisingly unpopular bit of legislation that ended up being
shelved.</p>
