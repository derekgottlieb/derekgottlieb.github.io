                    <p>Kait (aka <a href="http://kkblaze.blogspot.com/">student dr. blaze</a>) pinged me for an
internet meme she <a href="http://kkblaze.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-fun-silly-taking-up-webspace.html">filled
out</a>.
Since I&rsquo;m not sure I <em>know</em> many people with blogs, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to tap
<a href="http://thederivative.net">Richy</a> and see if he&rsquo;ll fill it out and pass it on.</p>
<ol>
<li>WERE YOU NAMED AFTER ANYONE? No</li>
<li>WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CRIED? Saturday</li>
<li>DO YOU LIKE YOUR HANDWRITING? Yes, but I wish I could find a pen I like
that&rsquo;d allow me to write even smaller while maintaining legibility</li>
<li>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LUNCH MEAT? turkey, or peanut butter</li>
<li>DO YOU HAVE KIDS? no, just 3 crazy cats</li>
<li>IF YOU WERE ANOTHER PERSON WOULD YOU BE FRIENDS WITH YOU? i think so.</li>
<li>DO YOU USE SARCASM A LOT? probably less than i used to?</li>
<li>DO YOU STILL HAVE YOUR TONSILS? yup</li>
<li>WOULD YOU BUNGEE JUMP? jumping off a perfectly good bridge ranks up there
with jumping out of a perfectly good airplane.  and by that I mean &ldquo;hell no&rdquo;</li>
<li>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE CEREAL? cinnamon toast crunch.  but you have to sing
the name like in the commercials</li>
<li>DO YOU UNTIE YOUR SHOES WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OFF? i generally avoid untying
shoes when i can avoid it.  if lazyness wasn&rsquo;t a good enough reason, the
fact that one of my cats tries to kill my shoelaces when their untied
(especially when I&rsquo;m wiggling them about ever so tauntingly while tying
them) is added motivation</li>
<li>DO YOU THINK YOU ARE STRONG? not particularly.  but when you have to get
through something, sometimes you just do.</li>
<li>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ICE CREAM? Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s Chubby Hubby</li>
<li>WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE ABOUT PEOPLE? hmmm&hellip; whether i think
they&rsquo;re idiots?</li>
<li>RED OR PINK? blue.  no yell&ndash; auuuuuuuugh!</li>
<li>WHAT IS YOUR LEAST FAVORITE THING ABOUT YOURSELF? hmm.  err.  ahh.  no
wait&hellip; maybe&hellip; my indecisiveness?</li>
<li>WHO DO YOU MISS THE MOST? my grandmother</li>
<li>DO YOU WANT EVERYONE TO SEND THIS BACK TO YOU? gotta go with precedent
here.  post it on your blogs &amp; pass it on</li>
<li>WHAT COLOR PANTS AND SHOES ARE YOU WEARING? khaki cargo shorts and barefoot</li>
<li>WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU ATE? a Kashi chewy Trail Mix granola bar</li>
<li>WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW? The Pipettes - Dirty Mind</li>
<li>IF YOU WHERE A CRAYON, WHAT COLOR WOULD YOU BE? given the standard
crayolas, I&rsquo;d probably also go with midnight blue.  although maybe i&rsquo;d go
with brooding gray if we were talking about <a href="http://www.emostudent.com/?p=12">emo
crayons</a> :)</li>
<li>WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE SMELLS? baking goodness&hellip; yeasty bread, cookies&hellip; mmmm</li>
<li>WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON YOU TALKED TO ON THE PHONE? my folks</li>
<li>DO YOU LIKE THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS TO YOU? but of course.  why else would
i fill this out if i didn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>FAVORITE SPORTS TO WATCH? battling robots.  battlebots was pretty sweet
when it first aired, but promptly got lame as you saw 20 different variants
of the same 1 or 2 robot ideas.  maybe it was all the limitations placed on
weapons (no projectiles, flamethrowers, etc)</li>
<li>HAIR COLOR? brown with an increasingly liberal sprinkling of gray</li>
<li>EYE COLOR? some sort of blue hazel type deal</li>
<li>ARE YOU: OVERWEIGHT, UNDERWEIGHT, JUST RIGHT, OR NEVER RIGHT? still over,
but much much better than i had been, and i&rsquo;ve managed to maintain what
i&rsquo;ve gotten down to without significantly denying myself tasty eats or
working out as much as i had been</li>
<li>DO YOU WEAR CONTACTS? nope, just glasses for distance when I&rsquo;m driving</li>
<li>FAVORITE FOOD? ouch.  have to pick just one?  i guess i&rsquo;d have to say papa
del&rsquo;s pan pizza.  BEST EVER!</li>
<li>SCARY MOVIES OR HAPPY ENDINGS? i like to mix it up.  the american
movie-going public seems to need happy endings, so i guess i&rsquo;d say scary
movies.  they&rsquo;re either &ldquo;re-animator funny&rdquo; or sometimes, maybe, creep me
out a bit which is always entertaining</li>
<li>LAST MOVIE YOU WATCHED? heat (1995 - de niro, pacino, val kilmer, jon
voight, tom sizemore, ashley judd, natalie portman&hellip; kickass)</li>
<li>WHAT COLOR SHIRT ARE YOU WEARING? green polo with white stripes</li>
<li>SUMMER OR WINTER? suppose i&rsquo;d say a winter if i had to choose.  always
liked the peace of it.</li>
<li>HUGS OR KISSES? hugs, definitely</li>
<li>FAVORITE DESSERT? maybe some good soft, chewy, fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies</li>
<li>WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING NOW? i&rsquo;m actually between books at the moment
after having re-read the dragon reborn, and the two books rachel gave us
(life of pi and the curious incident of the dog in the night-time)</li>
<li>WHAT IS ON YOUR MOUSE PAD? generally use the trackpad on the macbook pro, a
trackball at a desktop, and on rare occasions (e.g. when gaming on the mbp)
a portable mouse sans mousepad.  just don&rsquo;t care for mice all that much,
and don&rsquo;t care for the restrictions imposed by a mousepad</li>
<li>WHAT DID YOU WATCH ON T. V. LAST NIGHT? a couple of shows on the national
geographic channel&hellip; <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/ET/popup/200707082100.html">science of speed
eating</a>
and <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/ET/popup/200707082200.html">hooked: monster
fish</a></li>
<li>FAVORITE SOUND? a well-played acoustic guitar</li>
<li>ROLLING STONES OR BEATLES? beatles</li>
<li>WHAT IS THE FARTHEST YOU HAVE BEEN FROM HOME/HERE? Hong Kong</li>
<li>DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL TALENT? i can make goofy voices</li>
<li>WHERE WERE YOU BORN? baptist hospital in miami</li>
<li>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE VACATION SPOT? rather enjoyed Ireland, and would love
to go back some day</li>
<li>WHAT&rsquo;S THE ONE THING THAT YOU&rsquo;VE BEEN DYING TO DO BUT HAVEN&rsquo;T DONE YET?
crap, i don&rsquo;t know.  have a real job?</li>
<li>WHAT&rsquo;S THE ONE SIMPLE THING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY? amanda&rsquo;s laugh</li>
<li>HAVE YOU EVER TRULY BEEN IN LOVE? yes.  or did you miss the part where i&rsquo;m
married :)</li>
<li>WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR FAVORITE BOOK/AUTHOR? always enjoy Robert Jordan&rsquo;s Wheel of
Time series (although the series was dragging a bit before the most recent
book)</li>
<li>WHERE IS YOUR FAVORITE PLACE TO BE? sitting by a window on a rainy day</li>
<li>WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR PERSONAL THEME SONG? currently: the reputation - face it</li>
<li>ARE YOU REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN, A DEMOCRAT, OR AN INDEPENDENT? think
i&rsquo;m registered independent, but most of those bastards are &hellip; bastards.
barak obama at least seems promising</li>
<li>WHEN YOU WERE A KID, HOW DID YOU SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME? video games</li>
<li>WHAT IS THE AIR-SPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW? i don&rsquo;t know that &ndash;
auuuuuuuugh!</li>
