                    <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year.  Time to watch favorites like &ldquo;How the Grinch Stole
Christmas&rdquo; (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and
directed by Ron Howard) and &ldquo;A Christmas Story&rdquo; (they looked at me like i had
lobsters crawling out of my ears!).  Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me
before I had a chance to notice.  Fortunately I was able to get the little bit
of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as I
had feared.  The week or so after Thanksgiving was much worse, although I&rsquo;ll
admit I didn&rsquo;t bother with any insanity like Target or Walmart which can be a
little crazy all the time.  I was disappointed if not surprised to see that
CompUSA has yet to be really marking anything down by enough to make it
interesting.  5-10% off does not a chain-wide store-closing make.  Perhaps
after the holidays they&rsquo;ll get more desperate.</p>
<p>Anyway, the real reason I started this post is to write about a couple of
entertaining tidbits I heard kids say in church this year.  The first dates
back to Westminster in CU when Pastor Laura was asking the kids about
communion, what&rsquo;s the significance, what do we do, etc.  One rather astute
child stated quite plainly that &ldquo;we drink blood.&rdquo;  I suppose that about sums it
up.  Wasn&rsquo;t sure whether her grandma was going to laugh or cry after that one.
Second one happened a couple of weeks ago here at Grace in AL.  Some of the
youth from the church were leading children&rsquo;s time and trying to contrast Jesus
with the images the little kids associate with other kings.  Instead of jewels
you have the crown of thorns, etc.  When they asked what kings ride, the kids
piped up with a horse.  But when they asked what Jesus rode, the kids were a
little stumped.  Finally one of the more vocal youngsters announced that &ldquo;Jesus
rides a monkey&rdquo;.  He was quite adamant that he has seen Jesus ride a monkey.</p>
<p>Not sure where else to go after that one, but I hope this finds everyone in
good spirits and I&rsquo;ll wish everyone happy holidays!</p>
