                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago, we went up to Nashville and hit a number of the sights.
I&rsquo;ll go ahead and split this into two posts, since I&rsquo;ve only uploaded some of
the relevant photos so far.  The first day, we hit their recreation of the
<a href="http://www.nashville.gov/parthenon/">Parthenon</a>.  Apparently, it&rsquo;s actually
the second replica they&rsquo;ve built, with the first being built in 1897 to
celebrate their centennial but it was only built to last 6 months.  The locals
liked it so much, they elected to rebuild it in a more permanent manner.  It
now also hosts the city of Nashville&rsquo;s art museum.</p>
<p>After that, we hit the <a href="http://www.fristcenter.org">Frist Center for the Visual
Arts</a> to catch their exhibit featuring Monet to
Dali (on loan from the Cleveland Museum of Art).  The other exhibit featured
some of the work of Angelo Filomeno, who does really interesting (if a bit
disturbing) embroidery work on large silk panels.  From the Frist website, his
works feature &ldquo;embroidered images of fanged skulls, exploded peacocks, and
hovering insects.&rdquo;  Strangely enough, that was about all they had.  I have to
admit we were a bit disappointed overall.  We figured there&rsquo;d be a more
substantial art museum in a city the size of Nashville, but we arguably had a
better time at the Huntsville art museum (especially given the difference in
the price of admission).</p>
<p>Finally, we hit the <a href="http://lanemotormuseum.org">Lane Motor Museum</a> before
heading home.  By far the best stop of the day, especially since admission&rsquo;s
only $5 for an adult.  I don&rsquo;t know what Mr. Lane does for a living, but
apparently he must do pretty well for him to have accumulated such an
impressive selection of unusual autos predominantly from Europe and Japan.  The
collection includes everything from cars to
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/2461727521/">trikes</a> to
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/2461760663/">motorcycles</a> to a
massive <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/2461771475/">US Army LARC</a>
and other oddities like the
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/2461780215/">Helicron</a>.  All sorts
of cool stuff.  Go check it out!</p>
