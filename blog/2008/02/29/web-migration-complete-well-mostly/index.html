                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>So my hosting provider (was <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">textdrive</a>, now
<a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a>) is working on retiring all their old FreeBSD
servers they were leasing.  Yeah, it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me that you could lease
a server like that.  Anyway, they&rsquo;re buying up fancy &ldquo;Shared Accelerators&rdquo;
(8-core Opteron boxes with 4GB RAM/core from Sun running OpenSolaris) backed by
SunFire x4500 Thumpers running ZFS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d started off with this provider a couple years ago as part of a VC campaign
(give us a large wad of cash, and we&rsquo;ll give you an account for as long as
we&rsquo;re in business), and I&rsquo;d upgraded at some point when they had a similar
campaign that bumped up the specs on my hosting account and added their
Connector service (group email, calendar, etc services with their own chunk of
attached storage) and Strongspace service (large reliable online backup storage
accessible via sftp/rsync over ssh/web over ssl).  Anyway, all of this
translates into my having the equivalent of a &ldquo;Premier&rdquo; service (see
<a href="http://www.joyent.com/connector/pricing/">here</a>).  Long story short, I&rsquo;ve got
a lifetime account with the following specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connector: 100 users/100 GB</li>
<li>Strongspace: 100GB</li>
<li>Hosting: 50 websites, 20GB Disk, 60GB Bandwidth, 100 databases</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering what I paid for my initial VC lifetime account, and later the
upgrade that added Connector and Strongspace, and the fact this level of
account now runs $100/month, I think I got off like a bandit.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even
get close to a year of service with what I&rsquo;ve paid, and that&rsquo;s for &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo;
service at the above levels.</p>
<p>And the Premier level account means there&rsquo;s 14 other accounts/virtual servers
on my Shared Accelerator, so it should remain nice and snappy for me.  So far
it&rsquo;s been much zippier for my sites as they were getting kinda bogged down on
the old box.  I&rsquo;m not sure what all was going on there, if they&rsquo;d simply
oversubscribed the box or were starting to have issues with their storage
backend for the old servers since they were pushing hard to move away from
them, etc.</p>
<p>Now I just need to take some time to finish some of the manual migration for
changes from FreeBSD to OpenSolaris, and fix up some stuff that was broken a
while back due to a Wordpress upgrade.  I&rsquo;m also taking this opportunity to
start picking up Ruby on Rails, and am vaguely contemplating ditching Wordpress
in favor of something of my own creation built on RoR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early (i.e., I&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn about Rails), but so far it
looks like a really sexy web framework and I threw together something
resembling a blog after watching a 15-minute screencast that runs through the
process to getting a basic app up and running.  It&rsquo;s still very basic but
functional: add posts, edit them, list all posts, add comments to a post, and
some of the unit testing framework in Rails.  I&rsquo;ve started thinking about what
all else is really needed, and there&rsquo;s a fair bit: authentication (so only I
can post to the blog or edit stuff), more advanced comment handling (akismet
for spam, etc), categorization/tagging, searching through posts, and of course
actually putting some style into the whole thing with CSS.  But what I&rsquo;ve got&rsquo;s
a start and now that I&rsquo;ve got my performance issues sorted out following the
migration, I&rsquo;m not in as big a rush to dump Wordpress.</p>
