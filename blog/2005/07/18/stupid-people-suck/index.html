                    <p>I hate stupid people.  I can accept that the population at large is generally
clueless about all things tech, and so I have a fairly high tolerance level
when they do annoying newb things.  The people that really tick me off are the
ones who are clearly in a technical field (say, a whole bunch of people in
academia on a FPGA research/education mailing list), and are clearly clueless
about very basic concepts such as email&hellip;</p>
<p>The trouble all started this morning when some Computer Science and Engineering
associate prof at Penn State (funnily enough he got his PhD from a Florida
institution&hellip;) accidently tacked the address for the aforementioned massive
FPGA-related mailing list as a CC on a email intended for some prof about his
proposal for an upcoming conference.  This email was clearly intended for
members of the program committee, but ended up being sent out to I don&rsquo;t know
how many hundreds of people.  I can forgive that as a relatively honest mistake
(not sure how he managed to tack on a completely unrelated address, but I
suppose it could happen if you weren&rsquo;t careful).  The real problem is the flood
of idiots on the mailing list that feel the need to reply to the entire list
asking why they&rsquo;ve received this email&hellip;  Someone a few hours ago posted &ldquo;hey,
this guy screwed up, not meant for this list, please stop replying about it.&rdquo;
But it keeps on coming.  And there&rsquo;s this stupid .gov address that keeps
marking some of the messages as quarantined and proceeds to send yet another
email to the list letting everyone know that it didn&rsquo;t like that email&hellip;</p>
<p>Now if I can only figure out how to get off this damn list&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t actually
subscribe to it&hellip; went to a conference with the guy that runs it and he
automatically added all the attendees, and I think it&rsquo;s more of an old school
distribution list than a full-on automated mailing list.  Hasn&rsquo;t been too bad
in the past, but this is just ridiculous.</p>
