                    <p>Amanda and I just got back last night from a long weekend trip up to Chicago.
Headed up there Friday morning and hit the <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/">Shedd
Aquarium</a>, apparently oldest aquarium in the
country (founded 75 years ago).  Since we were planning on hitting lots of
museums, we picked up &ldquo;city passes&rdquo; that include admission to a number of
different sites in the area (if you see more than two of the six, I think you
made out well).  Pretty decent aquarium, but I could&rsquo;ve done without the
hoardes of screaming, ill-behaved, largely unsupervised ruffians running
around&hellip; and their special crabs! exhibit was poorly designed in my opinion
(layed out in a way that made it hard to see everything and designed with a
number of choke points that made it difficult to navigate through the crowds).
Always likes looking at the critters though.</p>
<p>On Saturday we hit the <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/">Field Museum</a>, natural
history type museum featuring everything from dinosaur bones (including a
special traveling exhibit that included recently unearthed critters in China),
ancient Egyptian artifacts, an impressive collection of stuffed critters, and
even a room of gemstones and a variety of jade pieces.  Found the dinosaur
stuff pretty cool as well as parts of the Egypt exhibit.  After the Field
Museum, we hit the <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/">Adler Planetarium</a>,
another first in the country (also founded 75 years ago).  Not nearly as
impressive as the other two, but since it didn&rsquo;t cost us anything beyond the
base city pass price, I can&rsquo;t complain too much.</p>
<p>Sunday we met up with Rachel and checked out the <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/">Art Institute of
Chicago</a>.  Pretty cool stuff as always, and it was
good to see Rachel as always.  Lots of impressionist stuff that Amanda likes,
and some pretty wild surrealist stuff that I sometimes like.  Will have to see
if I can&rsquo;t remember the name of that Spanish surrealist that wasn&rsquo;t Dalí and
see if I can&rsquo;t see some more of his work&hellip; (just did a quick googling and it&rsquo;s
Yves Tanguy).</p>
<p>Monday we wrapped up our trip with a visit to the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/">Museum of Science and
Industry</a>.  I have to say, the museum wasn&rsquo;t nearly
as impressive as I remember it&hellip;  granted a number of their
demos/educationally interactive thingamajigs appeared to be in need of service
(some marked as such, some just didn&rsquo;t do anything when you poked them), and
some weren&rsquo;t done as well as one might have hoped or weren&rsquo;t even remotely
educational.  Case in point the special video game exhibit was little more than
a room set up as an arcade featuring a handful of classics as well as a range
of console games.  I was hoping for a bit more history and a bit less &ldquo;ooh neat
I can play the first version of Street Fighter.&rdquo;  There were a few highlights
such as a DEC PDP-1 (one of the first &ldquo;minis&rdquo; if I remember correctly&hellip;
basically a computer that wasn&rsquo;t a mainframe requiring an entire room/building
to house it).  And of course the captured U-505 submarine.  Over the past few
years, they&rsquo;ve apparently put a lot of work into restoring it to
authentic/original condition and moved it indoors.  Very well done exhibit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all good things must come to and end, and by that I mean we&rsquo;re
back in CU and back at work&hellip;  Hopefully I can get around to uploading some
photos from the trip this evening.</p>
