                    <p>A while back Lee clued me into <a href="http://www.emusic.com">eMusic</a>, a cool indie
music mp3 site (subscription based, but their high-quality, mp3s unencumberd by
any crappy drm).  Managed to stumble over <a href="http://www.angieheaton.com/">Angie
Heaton</a> who has a few albums out.  Was listening
to her when Amanda asked me who that was&hellip; when  I told her, she said Rachel
had listened to her.  I took that as a cue to ask Rachel what she listened to
next time I saw her.  She clued me into the fact Angie&rsquo;s local and also
recommended another local act, Sarge.  Loved their 3 albums, and found the lead
singer Elizabeth Elmore is currently in <a href="http://www.reputationmusic.com/">The
Reputation</a> up in Chicago.  All good stuff,
but like all good things I hungered for more.</p>
<p>Found out the bassist from Sarge, <a href="http://www.rachelrawks.com/">Rachel Switzky</a>
(turns out she played with Sarge while in grad school at UIUC), had also played
in <a href="http://www.parasol.com/artists/corndolly.asp">Corndolly</a>&hellip; that also
happened to feature Angie on drums.  This was the first item I&rsquo;d run across
that wasn&rsquo;t available on eMusic, but was available from <a href="http://www.parasol.com/">Parasol
Records</a>.  <a href="http://thederivative.net">Richy</a> had
mentioned they had a brick &amp; mortar shop over in Urbana, so I checked their
website and noticed
<a href="http://www.parasol.com/catalog/catalog.asp?zoomtitle=18171&amp;thepage=/catalog/catalog.asp">Liquorette</a>,
another band featuring Angie.  Headed on over there after work and part way
through checking out it came out that the person helping me was in fact Angie
herself.  Very cool.  She was even nice enough to walk around with me and make
recommendations&hellip; suggested her albums, which I already had, and Sarge&rsquo;s
albums, which I also already had&hellip; :).  Very cool though.</p>
<p>I suppose that while I&rsquo;m at it, I should mention that CU has traditionally been
an indie-pop hotbed.  You&rsquo;ve got the aformentioned artists, Red Hot Valentines,
Fiery Furnace, Wofie, The Blackouts (now The Living Blue), Beezus, and who
knows how many more.  Oh, and REO Speedwagon was from here too, for what that&rsquo;s
worth.</p>
