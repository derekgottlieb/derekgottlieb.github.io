                    <p>Heard this great quote from the late/great Seymour Cray: &ldquo;If you were plowing a
field, which would you rather use: Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?&rdquo;
Apparently he said this in response to a question about the growing use of
large clusters of commodity PCs for supercomputing applications.  Traditional
wisdom would suggest it&rsquo;s much better to design the heck out of two very
powerful processors and ease the parallel programming burden to achieve high
performance.  Historically it&rsquo;s been much more difficult to parallelize an
application over large numbers of less powerful processors, and equally
difficult to beat out the oxen.</p>
<p>This was brought up yesterday in the context of IBM&rsquo;s Blue Gene line of
supercomputers.  The NEC Earth Simulator previously held the crown with 35
gigaflops or something absurd like that (and required an equally absurd custom
building to house it), and have 5,120 processors.  IBM through sanity to the
wind and dreamt up Blue Gene which heads in the opposite direction: very large
numbers of low-power embedded processors.  At the moment, Blue Gene systems
hold like 5 of the top 10 slots (including #1 and #2) on the list of the <a href="http://www.top500.org/lists/plists.php?Y=2005&amp;M=06">Top
500 Supercomputers</a>, and go
up to 65,536 processors.  They&rsquo;d even mentioned a Blue Gene with 131k
processors.  And they&rsquo;re actually managing to parallelize programs on these
beasts using 100k+ processors at once (when no one else in the industry has
accomplished this for even 10k?).  Wild stuff.  Oh, and if I understood
correctly, two Blue Gene racks equalled the number of flops churned out by that
full building worth of the Earth Simulator&hellip;</p>
