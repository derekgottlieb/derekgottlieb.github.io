                    <p>So far everyone in our bunch (Amanda, yours truly, Katie and Amanda&rsquo;s Mom)
seems pretty pleased with Verizon.  My phone actually tanked this morning&hellip;
Picked it up to head off to work when I noticed it wasn&rsquo;t on.  Tried to turn it
and and it wouldn&rsquo;t.  Figured battery&rsquo;s just dead.  So I plug it in real quick
and it powers up.  Starts the charging procedure and quickly says the battery&rsquo;s
fully charged?!  As soon as I pull the AC power, it turns itself off.  Pop over
to the Verizon store and aside from the wait to get a customer service person,
they checked it out, popped in a new battery, it worked as it should so they
did an exchange with no money changing hands.</p>
<p>That may not seem like much (ie in my world, that&rsquo;s the way it should be when
the battery in your 3 month old phone calls it quits), but since I&rsquo;ve seen how
so many other businesses fail to operate&hellip; this was impressive.  Whenever
Amanda would go into Cingular about problems with her phone, they&rsquo;d just give
her crappy &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; like removing and reinserting the battery or ripping up
some paper and jamming it in the battery compartment.  If pressed to do more,
they&rsquo;d just shake their heads and offer to let her trade it in and buy a new
phone for $300+.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m not exactly pleased the old battery tanked like it did (I can see DOA
issues with tech hardware, but failures like this make me wonder), I can&rsquo;t
really fault Verizon.  They certainly handled the situation better than I could
have hoped.</p>
