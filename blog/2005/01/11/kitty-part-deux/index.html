                    <p>We adopted our second kitty this past Sunday.  He is an adorable 8-week old
black and white kitten.  He&rsquo;s predominantly black with a little white stripe
down his nose, a white chin and tummy, and white paws.  As per the suggestion
of his previous home (one of Amanda&rsquo;s co-workers), we&rsquo;ve decided to call him
Spooky.  I kept thinking of the X-Files (Fox &ldquo;Spooky&rdquo; Mulder), and he seems to
spook pretty easily for a kitty as curious and fearless as he appears to be.
Unsurprisingly, I&rsquo;ve got some pics up over at my
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgottlieb/sets/1144844/">gallery</a>.  He is
really quite adorable, so we&rsquo;re hoping Merry will learn to like him and they
can play together nicely.</p>
<p>I took him to the vet yesterday since he&rsquo;s got some sort of upper respiratory
infection (lots of sneezing and discharge from his eyes).  We&rsquo;ve got a
combination of oral antibiotics and some goop we have to put in his eyes twice
a day for 10 days.  It&rsquo;s unpleasant but doable for two people, but I&rsquo;ve
discovered my own personal hell this morning.  Trying to both hold him still
and administer this stuff alone.  You really need more than two hands to do it.
I can just imagine how horrific it would be to do this to him day-in/day-out
till the end of time.  I feel horrible doing it to him and couldn&rsquo;t fathom it
if I didn&rsquo;t know it was to make him feel better in the end.  Vaccinations will
have to wait until we get this infection cleared up.</p>
