                    <p>So recently I&rsquo;d been thinking a fair bit about how good some old DOS games were
back in the day.  The ones that really came to mind were the Ultima series
(particularly U6: The False Prophet, U7: The Black Gate, and U7: Serpent Isle).
Those were outstanding games.  I&rsquo;d done a bit of research and found
<a href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net">DOSBox</a>, which allows you to play a wide range
of old DOS games on an assortment of platforms (ie it performs x86/DOS
emulation).</p>
<p>Once I knew I could potentially get some of my old Ultima games up and running
on a modern machine without all the hassle of setting up VMware or something
like that with DOS installed and all the headaches in getting Ultima to run
natively in DOS, I decided to grab it when I next visited my folks.  Ended up
going through all my old crap anyway while I was there (which will shortly be
dropped off on my doorstep I&rsquo;ve recently realized).  But I digress.  Got Ultima
7: The Black Gate up and running on my notebook and realized there are still
some minor issues, some with DOSBox and some with the game itself (I&rsquo;d
forgotten just how buggy some of these games were).</p>
<p>Overall it was good.  After remembering that you have to save often (and you
have to make sure not to tick off Iolo with too much stealing), I ran across
<a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net">Exult</a>, which is actually an open-source Ultima
7 engine that reads from the old U7 data files, but is a completely rewritten
engine that runs natively on a number of different platforms (XP, Linux, OSX,
etc).  Being completely from scratch, it doesn&rsquo;t suffer from many of the bugs
present in the DOSBox/U7 combo, and even introduces a number of nice additional
features.  It&rsquo;s made the whole experience substantially more enjoyable.  Good
stuff!</p>
