                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>So a while back I started looking at alternative VPS hosting providers. I was
impressed by the service Linode provided, but started wondering if I&rsquo;d get
better bang for my buck going elsewhere. At the time, I was paying $20 / month
for their smallest Xen VPS or $25 / month if I wanted their backup service. My
hosting needs were modest, especially since I&rsquo;d migrated just about everything
from dynamic stuff with a DB backend to primarily serving static content. So I
could really get away with something with leaner. I shied away from the
extremely cheap OpenVZ providers, and tried a couple of different KVM VPS
providers before I found one that offered a balance of cost, reliability, and
performance.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;ve got a pair of VMs from
<a href="https://clientarea.ramnode.com/aff.php?aff=2255">RamNode</a> in different
datacenters (one in Atlanta and one in NYC), and one from
<a href="https://backupsy.com/aff.php?aff=371">Backupsy</a> (in Dallas). The ones from
RamNode have SSD-cached storage and are fairly performant, so I use them for
serving web content and other miscellaneous stuff I&rsquo;m tinkering with (VPN
endpoint, IRC proxy, docker host, config management, etc). The one from
Backupsy is less performant but includes 500GB of storage, so I ship backups
from the other VPS servers to it and can keep tons of historical backups. And I
run all of those for less than I was paying for a single Linode VPS with backup
service previously.</p>
<p>During this time, Linode hasn&rsquo;t been sitting idle. They&rsquo;ve done several major
upgrades to their infrastructure and clearly listened to their customers and
started offering a $10 / month plan that brings them down much closer to the
more budget providers. Not the sketchy OpenVZ providers that give you a 128MB
container for $5 / year, but no sane person would try to host anything serious
on one of those.</p>
<p>And if you were curious, I did tinker with AWS some as part of this. If you&rsquo;re
looking to run a couple of VMs, you&rsquo;ll get much better performance at a better
price with a more traditional VPS provider. As far as I can tell, Amazon only
really makes sense if really need the kind of scale they offer, especially if
you expect to only need that scale some of the time.</p>
<p>Oh. And I&rsquo;m glad I listened to <a href="/blog/2012/11/16/migration/">my instincts</a> and
never really used my TextDrive 2 hosting account for anything. They officially
shut down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextDrive">less than 2 years</a> after
they split off from Joyent as an olive branch to the remaining &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo;
account holders. It&rsquo;s hard to know whether it was a scheme to get those people
off the accounting books at Joyent and then quietly shut the service down or if
it just demonstrates the difficulty of running a shared web hosting provider
these days (a race to the bottom for the most part). At least some of their
support staff seemed to be working hard to try to keep things running and help
customers well past when they stopped getting paid to do so. My memory&rsquo;s a
little fuzzy at this point, but an utter disaster toward the end (drives
accidently wiped in 20 of their servers?) highlighted how you shouldn&rsquo;t rely on
using Amazon Glacier as your only form of backup (see <a href="http://www.jacquesmarneweck.com/2014/03/31/textdrive-update/">this post</a>).</p>
