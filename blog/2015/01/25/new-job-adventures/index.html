                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>About six months ago, I took a new job and left the position I&rsquo;d held at the
Alabama Supercomputer Center for roughly seven years. I&rsquo;ve struggled whether I
should write a post about why I chose to leave my old job or focus on the
positive and talk about my new job. If you&rsquo;re curious, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/fedbiz_daily/2014/04/morale-problems-at-csc-employees-sound-off.html?full=true">this article at the
Washington Business
Journal</a>
covers some of the shenanigans that motivated me to leave my job with CSC.</p>
<p>In spite of all of that, I still struggled with the decision to leave. ASC&rsquo;s
mission to support the educational community in Alabama was a big part of what
motivated me every day. I like the people I worked with, but during my time
there I went from being mostly indifferent about CSC to being somewhat ashamed
to say that I worked for them.</p>
<p>But on to the good news. Last July I started a new job at
<a href="http://www.digium.com">Digium</a>, a small telecommunications company in
Huntsville. You might be wondering why a company that makes PBX phone systems
and drives the development of <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> would need
someone with my background. Turns out they acquired a cloud services company
toward the end of 2013 that was selling PBXs on their OpenStack infrastructure.
Cloud infrastructure isn&rsquo;t all that different from an HPC compute cluster
that&rsquo;s picked a different spot in the cost / performance / reliability design
space, unless you&rsquo;re building an HPC cloud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a hoot so far and Amanda&rsquo;s commented on the improvement in my mood so
I guess it shows. My new role is more development-focused, so I don&rsquo;t have to
worry about day to day operations as much. We rolled out our first project that
affects customers about a week ago. We automated the ordering of phone number
and provisioning of SIP trunks (a VOIP phone line that can support multiple
simultaneous calls) when a customer orders one on the website. They should be
publicly announcing another of our projects later this week, so I should be
able to talk about that soon.</p>
