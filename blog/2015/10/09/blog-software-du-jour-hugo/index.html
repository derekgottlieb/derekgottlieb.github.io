                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>A few years ago, I&rsquo;d migrated from Wordpress to a static site generator for my blog as part
of <a href="/blog/2012/11/16/migration/">migrating off a shared web host to a VPS</a>. I&rsquo;d started with
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> since it had been getting a fair bit of buzz at the time.
I was pretty happy with the rendered output, but the underlying software had its flaws. The
author (Brandon Mathis) highlighted some of those flaws in his post on <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">the road to Octopress
3.0</a> and in various interviews I&rsquo;ve
heard him give. In reality, Octopress 2 was less of a blog engine than it was some guy&rsquo;s
Jekyll-based blog with a mix of plugins, tweaks, and configurations to end up with the
feature set he wanted. It made getting a nice result out of Jekyll easy, so a lot of folks
(myself included) simply forked his repo and piled our own changes/tweaks on top of it. If
you decide you want to update based on improvements he&rsquo;d made, you were stuck trying to <code>git merge</code> in his changes and hoping you didn&rsquo;t break anything or have too many merge conflicts
to resolve as a result.</p>
<p>Mathis seems to have learned a lot from his work trying to maintain version 2 as something
others could consume. Version 3 aims to be modular (Octopress functionality delivered as a
large collection of ruby gems you can pick and choose between) and should better complement
Jekyll than before. It seems like it&rsquo;s been a major undertaking (they&rsquo;ve got ~50 gems at this
point). I suppose it&rsquo;s not entirely surprising to me that they haven&rsquo;t yet made a big public
announcement about 3.0&rsquo;s release even though they&rsquo;ve been working on the rewrite for ~3
years. Based on gem versions, it certainly looks like individual gems are &ldquo;production-ready&rdquo;,
but I&rsquo;m guessing there are some things they&rsquo;ve decided are release requirements that they
still haven&rsquo;t ironed out yet. Last I&rsquo;d heard that involved the theme system and probably some
documentation including a migration path from 2 to 3, but that was several months ago.</p>
<p>I really hadn&rsquo;t intended for this to be a post about Octopress 3, but that&rsquo;s certainly what
it seems to have turned into. I migrated my blog from Octopress 2 to 3 a back in February and
in June moved it to be hosted on Github Pages. I&rsquo;ve found minor things that annoyed me, so I
decided to try out <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It took a little bit of work to get my content
ported over and a theme tweaked to my liking, but overall I&rsquo;ve been pretty impressed so far.
It&rsquo;s still a very young project, but it&rsquo;s blazing fast to render a few hundred posts and
gives me an opportunity to poke around in some <a href="https://golang.org/">Go code</a> since I&rsquo;ve been
looking for an excuse. Being such a young project, it&rsquo;s not without its issues (documented
examples for deploying to Github pages are&hellip; complex), but it certainly has some upsides.
Downloading a single Go binary and your content is all it takes to set up a system to build
sites with it unlike Octopress where I&rsquo;m likely to install a mountain of ruby stuff to get to
that point. Not a big deal for me since I&rsquo;m doing a lot of ruby these days anyway, but that&rsquo;s
not something I could readily hand off to someone else. I may end up coming back to Octopress
due to my greater familiarity with ruby, but for now I&rsquo;m pretty sold on Hugo and may need to try it out for some other semi-static websites.</p>
