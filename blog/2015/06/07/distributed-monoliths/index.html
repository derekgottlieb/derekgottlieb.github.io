                    <p>As part of developing RESTful HTTP APIs at work, there&rsquo;s been a lot of
discussion over the &ldquo;best&rdquo; way to architect/implement everything. To avoid
relying strictly on my own instincts and relearning mistakes that many others
have already learned from, I&rsquo;ve been reading O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do">Building
Microservices</a>. I haven&rsquo;t
finished it yet, but have gotten a lot out of what I&rsquo;ve read so far (and been
pleased to see that my instincts have been largely supported by someone who&rsquo;s
experienced implementing such systems).</p>
<p>The chapter on Integration presents the idea of &ldquo;the shared database&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<a href="#buildingmicroservices%5D">p.
41, 1</a>]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as possibly the most common and
<em>seemingly</em> simple form of integration between different services. You&rsquo;ve split
your environment into multiple applications/services, but decided the way they
should operate on shared data is by hooking directly into the same database.  I
found this section especially interesting because this approach has been
championed by some around the office, but I had strong concerns about it and
many of those were highlighted in the book.</p>
<ol>
<li>The database schema becomes a large shared API. Any schema changes you want
to make (e.g., improved data representation, new logic in one service
requires table changes, etc) now requires careful planning and regression
testing to avoid breaking any of the services that interact with the
database.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve lost loose coupling between your services because you can no longer
change implementation details (e.g., moving from an RDBMS to a NoSQL system)
because every consumer that interacts with it is tightly coupled to those
low-level implementation details. This can also introduce restrictions on
the technology choices for consumers since they&rsquo;ll be limited to options
that have the required driver support.</li>
<li>Major DRY violations / loss of cohesion. Logic associated with interacting
with the data in the database is now spread across every consumer. You&rsquo;re
forced to replicate code and have to remember to update it everywhere, which
is likely to be an error prone process.</li>
</ol>
<p>After thinking about it, I decided this approach is effectively building a
<strong>distributed monolith</strong>. As with most clever things I think up, I&rsquo;m not the
first to coin this term and a quick Googling turns up a handful of unique
sources. Oddly enough, one was posted the same day I wrote this post. At least
it was close to having a novel thought. Oldest reference I could find dates
back ~7 months to November 2014. Oh well. At least it wasn&rsquo;t yet another thing
everyone&rsquo;s excited they &ldquo;invented&rdquo; that IBM had already done back in the 1960s
(and everyone promptly forgot about).</p>
