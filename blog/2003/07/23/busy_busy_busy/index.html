                    <p>Well, as you probably could have guessed by the lack of posts, I&rsquo;ve been quite
busy this summer.  Submitted a paper to <a href="http://www.ac.uma.es/hpca10/">HPCA</a>
(International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture for those
not in the know).  Crossing my fingers that it gets accepted because I&rsquo;ve been
working my ass off for it, and it would be cool for my work to appear in a big
conference like HPCA, and hella cool to get to go to Madrid to present it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty psyched that I managed to pull this paper off because Nick
originally had three separate papers shooting for this one.  One was axed
toward the end of last week, and until I updated him on my progress, Nick was
figuring the other remaining paper was in better shape than mine.  Turns out,
the other paper also fell through some time early Monday afternoon.  Nick told
me around 2PM that the other paper had &ldquo;imploded.&rdquo;  Oh well, at least that
meant that Nick completely put his all into cleaning up my paper which we got
submitted within a minute or so of the deadline.  Very stressful, but now over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure cuz I was pretty hazy by the time it got submitted, but I think it
turned out pretty well.  Looks real impressive.  It&rsquo;s got some figures, some
snazzy formulas, a table full of numbers, and all sorts of fancy plots.  Looks
real professional like.  For those who are interested, it focuses on how the
increasing component latencies resulting from deep submicron technologies
affect the performance of clustered microarchitectures.   Now that I&rsquo;ve lost
most of you&hellip;</p>
<p>Since I have been so totally and completely burned out for several days, I&rsquo;m
largely taking this week off, and next week I&rsquo;ll be visiting the folk with
Amanda.  Will be nice to just get away for a while.</p>
