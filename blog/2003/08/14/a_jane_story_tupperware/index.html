                    <p>So State Farm, or at least the actuarial department, has a policy that
co-workers do not bring in food to help you celebrate your birthday (or any
other celebration-worthy event).  That would be dumb since you end up having to
bring in food frequently in a large department.  State Farm&rsquo;s solution: the
person celebrating is expected to bring in food for the department in order to
celebrate.  That way, you only need to bring in food once a year (ie your own
birthday).  While it is not a written rule that you have to bring in food for
your own event, everyone will give you crap if you don&rsquo;t.  There&rsquo;s just
something wrong with that&hellip; having to throw your own birthday party.</p>
<p>But I digress.  The real reason I bring this up is Jane&rsquo;s behavior on such
days.  She keeps Tupperware in her desk for the sole purpose of snagging a
bunch of the birthday person&rsquo;s leftovers to take home herself.  Can you get
more tacky?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not quite the end of it.  You see, people in the department have
learned not to eat food that has been set out for general consumption unless
they have been explicitly been informed that Jane didn&rsquo;t bring it in.  She
apparently has a habit of buying cakes and such from the supermarket.  She
lives alone and really can&rsquo;t eat a whole cake before it goes bad.  So she will
eat what she wants for several days, and after it has become dry and stale,
she&rsquo;ll bring it into work for everyone else to &ldquo;enjoy.&rdquo;  Such a class act.</p>
<p>Reminds me a  bit of my uncle&rsquo;s co-worker who had a habit of bringing in
day-old donuts he snagged out of the dumpster behind Dunkin'.  Or the time he
brought in homemade &ldquo;venison stew.&rdquo;  He neglected to mention that he managed to
run into a deer on his way to work the previous morning.  Tossed the carcass in
his trunk and left it there&hellip; baking&hellip; in the hot sun all day.  Hadn&rsquo;t even
bothered to field dress it.  Suffice it to say there were some ill people after
that one&hellip;</p>
