                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to add a new category.  I think I&rsquo;ll title it &ldquo;Tales of the
Weird&rdquo;, but for some reason I suspect simply &ldquo;Jane Stories&rdquo; would be more
accurate.  As such, I&rsquo;ll start this category off with a brief introduction to
Jane.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, Jane is one of Amanda&rsquo;s co-workers over at State
Farm corporate in Bloomington.  Anyway, Jane is a weird little critter that
should have been fired long ago, but somehow due to the ineptitude present in
corporate America, continues to be paid to occupy space.</p>
<p>She was originally an actuarial student like Amanda is currently, but was
surprisingly tossed out of the program eventually.  You see, until they&rsquo;ve
passed the requisite number of actuarial exams, you aren&rsquo;t considered a
certified actuary.  As a result, companies have &ldquo;actuarial students&rdquo; who do
actuarial work but are in the process of taking the grueling actuarial exams
offered every 6 months.  State Farm has a policy for how it handles the fact
that most people don&rsquo;t pass an exam their first time out.  Basically, they will
pay for everything on the first attempt and progressively less for each attempt
after up to 3 attempts.  According to their company guidelines, there will be
no more than 3 attempts.  If a student fails to pass an exam within 3 attempts
while working at State Farm, they will be tossed out of the student program and
become a lowly tech (ie mindless data entry and such).</p>
<p>To cut a long story short (too late), Jane took one test like 5 times (keep in
mind this was exam 3 of 8, and the first two only cover basic calculus and
such).  Her boss then decided that maybe she just had a mental block and would
regain her confidence if she could go pass one of the later exams.  So she took
the next one a few times and repeatedly failed.  After it had long become clear
that there was no chance in hell she could ever pass these introductory exams
(and the later ones are much harder), they finally kicked her out of the
student program.  What a surprise that day was.</p>
<p>Anyway, if that&rsquo;s all there was to Jane, then that would be one thing.  There&rsquo;d
be nothing interesting for me to write about here other than she&rsquo;s not cut out
to be an actuary.  That&rsquo;s certainly not interesting, because a lot of us aren&rsquo;t
cut out for that, and it&rsquo;s by no means a reason to fire her.  I would certainly
not be writing about someone who simply failed in their chosen career.   Oh no,
there&rsquo;s much more.  You see, Jane is an utter loon.  She has the inter-personal
skills of a brick and tends to sway between somewhat annoying to downright
disturbing.</p>
<p>This category will largely focus on her quirky behavior&hellip; just as soon as I
can remember some of the stories Amanda has shared with me.</p>
