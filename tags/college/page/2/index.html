                <p>Been rather busy lately. Went to my cousin&rsquo;s wedding 3 weekends ago in Missouri/Kansas. Then flew down to Amanda&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s wedding in Texas 2 weekends ago. My folks have been visiting this past week and just left on Sunday morning. To top that off, I&rsquo;ve had some sort of nasty sinus infection for the past week. Next weekend we&rsquo;re off to Iowa for Amanda&rsquo;s coworker&rsquo;s wedding and on the way back I&rsquo;ll be going to ISCA &lsquo;05 in Wisconsin for a few days.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve decided to work a bit on porting over some of my old content to the new site/format. So far, I&rsquo;ve converted over the pages about the senior design project I developed with John, the UR-5beta. Figure I may put up a copy of my public key at some point, but since the only one I use with any regularity is already up at my CRHC site, I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s much point.</p>

                <p>So as of a few weeks ago, they finally got the parking deck close enough to &ldquo;finished&rdquo; to open it. By &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, I mean the bulk of the structure is there, but they&rsquo;re still actively working on it. Like putting in the sidewalks around it, putting in the street to the south, actually building up the 1st floor interior (where all the &ldquo;retail&rdquo; is supposed to go). Oh, and of course installing the elevators.</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;m finally getting close to wrapping up this semester, which marks the end of my required course credits. All of the stuff for Nick&rsquo;s class finished up yesterday afternoon. The slides for all of the project presentations are up at the ECE497NC website. We managed to slap together something for the poster session for Matt&rsquo;s class this afternoon. Went ok, but since a large portion of the project is compiler stuff, and I haven&rsquo;t the remotest clue about compilers in general so&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t much help in fielding questions.</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been going nuts working on class projects this semester. I&rsquo;m trying to wrap up the last of my class work and am currently taking a couple of ECE497 courses (special topics grad courses where professors largely discuss their own research interests).
Nick&rsquo;s teaching one on Unconventional Computer Architecture that&rsquo;s been pretty interesting so far. Project&rsquo;s coming along pretty well for that and most of my responsibilities have been finished.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2003/02/17/logic_simulator/'><h1>Logic Simulator</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>After a little bit of work, I got the simulation of 32 input vectors in parallel up and running in my simulator. Pretty sweet. Shouldn&rsquo;t be too bad to get basic sequential circuit support added in and then I&rsquo;ll have done both extra credit options. Mainly need to figure out how to time my program and the rest is trivial. Will probably look into doing some further optimizing of my code, but seems pretty zippy for any circuit I&rsquo;ve run it on so far.</p>

                <p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy this past week, and haven&rsquo;t really had time to post. Chi-Wei checked in fixes for the bulk of the bugs I had encountered in the gui, so I&rsquo;m pretty happy. I can actually sorta use the thing now. More importantly, Jeff and I have made some comments about additional features we REALLY want, so with any luck, we&rsquo;ll actually get some of those before long.</p>
