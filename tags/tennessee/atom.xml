      <description>A couple of weeks ago, we went up to Nashville and hit a number of the sights. I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and split this into two posts, since I&amp;rsquo;ve only uploaded some of the relevant photos so far. The first day, we hit their recreation of the Parthenon. Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s actually the second replica they&amp;rsquo;ve built, with the first being built in 1897 to celebrate their centennial but it was only built to last 6 months.</description>

      <description>Those of you who know me should know why I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated in a long time. Amanda and I had a very long month when we went down to Huntsville for Mike&amp;rsquo;s wedding. We had our baby Isaac prematurely, and after fighting for three long weeks in the Huntsville NICU, he passed away peacefully in our arms. We&amp;rsquo;re still having a hard time with it, but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s good to talk about it.</description>
