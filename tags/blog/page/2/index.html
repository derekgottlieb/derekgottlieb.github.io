                <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve gotten the critical stuff transferred over. Stuff that&rsquo;s up and running:
 DNS now points to my new server. Email has all been transferred over (hooray for IMAP!). My databases are up and running (although not set up quite how Iâ€™d like). The blog is functional (along with most of the site, since I&rsquo;m using WordPress as a basic content management system for a large portion of the site).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2006/02/10/switching-servers/'><h1>Switching servers...</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Looks like I&rsquo;m finally going to get around to moving Malkier over to a new server.
iPowerWeb has been decent as far as hosting providers go, but they&rsquo;re clearly targetting a different market than whatever category I fall into. They provide (read: push) a bunch of web business stuff, but don&rsquo;t seem to be quite as concerned with cool webtech or security. The server I&rsquo;m on has been hit by security flaws on a few occasions, resulting in either server downtime or mass defacement of the php source throughout my site&hellip; inserted spam code in every php file on my site&hellip; Funny because it pointed to a non-existent web address and was written in such a way that every page it was on was broken and wouldn&rsquo;t even render in a browser.</p>

                <p>Finally got the site back up. Turns out there was some sort of security breach this past weekend that slipped evil javascript into all of my php/html pages on the site. Looked like it was intended to be some sort of browser buffer overflow attack or something along those lines (the support folk at ipowerweb said it would download a virus?). Anyway, things should be cleared up and safe again for now.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/06/27/movies-themed/'><h1>Movies DB themed</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Finally got around to integrating my movies page with the rest of the site. It&rsquo;s definitely hacky at this point (made a custom wordpress page style containing most of the php code and simply created an empty page that uses that style), but at least it works. Still need to refine it some. I stripped out most of the db fields from getting displayed since I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t have as much screen width to work with, but I should fine tune what I display.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/05/30/domain-name-greed/'><h1>Domain Name Greed</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I did a little more research into the gottlieb.* domain names. I had considered something along those lines before ending up with malkier.com since all the appropriate gottlieb stuff was taken. Most are held by legitimate parties (ie people/businesses with the name gottlieb), but gottlieb.net is actually being squatted on by a rather shifting looking domain service, buydomains.com. Turns out these scumbags run around buying up domains with the hopes that someone would buy them for a pretty penny.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/02/19/wordpress-pages/'><h1>WordPress... pages</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So the pages feature looks like it&rsquo;ll be pretty slick. I&rsquo;ve managed to set up the main frontpage for the site so that it loads up the page I created inside of WP. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s the most efficient way to do it, but it does work. Definitely looks like WP is well on it&rsquo;s way to being a fairly complete CMS (content management system). Will have to see if I can differentiate between blog pages and normal content pages so that I can have a reduced sidebar for all things not blog.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/02/18/wordpress-upgrade/'><h1>WordPress upgrade</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>As you may notice, I&rsquo;m in the middle of upgrading my WordPress install for the blog. I thought I&rsquo;d gotten the key stuff translated over to the new setup, so I switched over to the new stuff. While my blog looks mostly right (sans access buttons in the header), I&rsquo;d forgotten that a lot of the rest of my site was using chunks of old blog code for their appearance. Hence, when I swapped them out, the rest of the stuff tanked.</p>

                <p>Slowly making progress on the transition to 1.5. You&rsquo;ll note I sorta have the links back up in the header, but they aren&rsquo;t formatted like the rest of the site quite yet&hellip; And I still need to integrate the rest of the site with the new theme code instead of having to keep around the old blog code.
I&rsquo;ve made a mock-up of the malkier frontpage that you can see here.</p>

                <p>Decided to make a new header graphic yesterday. Figured the Matrix-esque binary conflicted a bit with the title &ldquo;Pondering Dragonflies&rdquo;&hellip; especially since I&rsquo;m using the header graphic throughout the site and not just on the blog, and the site&rsquo;s named Malkier. So what better to catch the essence of something like Malkier? An old castle of course! Dug through some of my Ireland photos and came up with that pic of Blarney castle.</p>

                <p>So, I&rsquo;ve decided to try out a new header image. Last one was a bit too girly. The new one&rsquo;s not quite as &ldquo;artsy,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s definitely a bit manly-er (is that even a word?) and a whole lot geekier.</p>
