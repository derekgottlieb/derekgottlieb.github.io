      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-im-reading&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ghost Story&amp;rdquo;, Peter Straub (audiobook). I was hopeful after having enjoyed his collaborations with Stephen King
(&amp;ldquo;The Talisman&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Black House&amp;rdquo;). While I enjoyed some of the prose, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would&amp;rsquo;ve made it through if I
were reading it instead of listening while doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The End of the World: Stories of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, multiple authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files&amp;rdquo;, Jim Butcher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Odyssey&amp;rdquo;, Homer / Emily Wilson (translator) (audiobook).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor&amp;rdquo;, Ally Carter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>My Reading Trends and 2019 Highlights</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2022/12/01/my-reading-trends-and-2019-highlights/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2019, I decided to make a more committed effort to reading in my free time, I think
somewhat prompted by Goodreads&amp;rsquo; annual reading challenge feature combined with the added
convenience of reading on a Kindle. I read ~30 books that year, with a mix of books I read for
myself and ones I read aloud to the kids as part of our long-standing nightly bedtime routine.
With a shift to working from home during 2020 and increased work schedule flexibility, that
ramped up to ~100 books in 2020 and ~150 in 2021. This year I discovered audiobooks and started
listening to them during times I would have listened to podcasts previously, which meant even
more time for books (over 250 so far this year). I&amp;rsquo;m not usually one to write a review or even
rate books as I read them, but have been thinking it would be nice to better capture some that
I&amp;rsquo;ve either particularly enjoyed or have made a strong impression on me. With that in mind,
here are my highlights from 2019 (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Neverwhere&amp;rdquo; by Neil Gaiman: Absolutely lovely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impossible Times series by Mark Lawrence (&amp;ldquo;One Word Kill&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Limited Wish&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Dispel Illusion&amp;rdquo;): Fun Time Travel? Sign me up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kingkiller Chronicle series by Patrick Rothfuss (&amp;ldquo;The Name of the Wind&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Wise Man&amp;rsquo;s Fear&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;The Slow Regard of Silent Things&amp;rdquo;): I felt the early part of the 1st book dragged a bit for me, but once it picked up I loved this series. Really hopeful it continues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sixth World series by Rebecca Roanhorse (&amp;ldquo;Trail of Lightning&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Storm of Locusts&amp;rdquo;): Post apocalyptic setting, urban fantasy, and Din√© mythology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skyward series by Brandon Sanderson (&amp;ldquo;Skyward&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Starsight&amp;rdquo;): Enjoyable YA sci-fi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dragon Pearl&amp;rdquo; by Yoon Ha Lee: Another YA sci-fi, elements of Korean (?) mythology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Rising saga by Pierce Brown (&amp;ldquo;Red Rising&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Golden Son&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Morning Star&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Iron Gold&amp;rdquo;): Violent dystopian sci-fi. Strong Hunger Games vibe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I finally finished the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson (&amp;ldquo;Towers of Midnight&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;A Memory of Light&amp;rdquo;): I found some of the books struggled with pacing, which put me off for a while. Glad I saw it through to the end. I&amp;rsquo;ve happily gone back and re-read or listened to some of the early books in the series more than once.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>As part of developing RESTful HTTP APIs at work, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of discussion over the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; way to architect/implement everything. To avoid relying strictly on my own instincts and relearning mistakes that many others have already learned from, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Building Microservices. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it yet, but have gotten a lot out of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far (and been pleased to see that my instincts have been largely supported by someone who&amp;rsquo;s experienced implementing such systems).</description>
