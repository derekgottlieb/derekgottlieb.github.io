      <description>Starting in 2019, I decided to make a more committed effort to reading in my free time, I think somewhat prompted by Goodreads&amp;rsquo; annual reading challenge feature combined with the added convenience of reading on a Kindle. I read ~30 books that year, with a mix of books I read for myself and ones I read aloud to the kids as part of our long-standing nightly bedtime routine. With a shift to working from home during 2020 and increased work schedule flexibility, that ramped up to ~100 books in 2020 and ~150 in 2021.</description>

      <description>As part of developing RESTful HTTP APIs at work, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of discussion over the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; way to architect/implement everything. To avoid relying strictly on my own instincts and relearning mistakes that many others have already learned from, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Building Microservices. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it yet, but have gotten a lot out of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far (and been pleased to see that my instincts have been largely supported by someone who&amp;rsquo;s experienced implementing such systems).</description>
