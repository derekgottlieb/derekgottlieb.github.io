                <p>Been poking around looking for useful/interesting add-ons for Gmail. Here&rsquo;s a few I&rsquo;ve come up with:
Gmail notifier - Windows tray app that checks for new mail, sets Gmail as the default mailto handler, official Google add-on GNOME GTray - notifier for Linux GML (GMail loader) - import mail from your old mail client (supports a wide variety) gExodus graphical import util FreePOPs - POP3 interface for a variety of webmails, including Gmail GmailFS turns a Gmail account into a mountable Linux filesystem </p>

                <p>So apparently, MS is actually testing out Linux now before making their claims that Windows is better. The part I found most entertaining was a quote from a former IBM Linux supporter who&rsquo;s been hired on at MS. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no set architecture in Linux. All roads lead to madness.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been pretty religiously watching The Screensavers on G4/TechTV since I noticed the cable company added it to the lineup. Pretty entertaining show, and they sometimes have some cool bits on there. This past week they had a Best of: Free and Cheap episode detailing a number of free/cheap downloads and tips. I found a couple of segments of particular interest:
Linksys WRT54G - a lot of the Linksys network hardware runs Linux, and so they&rsquo;ve had to release the source under GPL.</p>

                <p>Ok. So I was poking around Gamestop, and ran across this. Can you believe it? For those of you who just couldn&rsquo;t get enough leather, a leather computer mouse?
Anyway, I can&rsquo;t wait till Doom 3 hits shelves, hopefully tomorrow. Now I just have to wait for Half-Life 2, which looks awesome.</p>

                <p>So earlier this week I noticed they had added an LED array display inside every bus. Reason I noticed this is because one of them was randomly displaying some info. Most of it was debugging stuff. What&rsquo;s the version number of this unit, how much memory does it have, what time/day is it (which was totally wrong), etc. You get the idea. Occasionally, it would scroll street intersection info across the screen (like &ldquo;PROSPECT AND KIRBY&rdquo;).</p>

                <p>So I have officially sworn off Philips. Not the screwdriver, the electronic manufacturer. I was a little confused when I pulled the dead/flaky CDRW/DVD drive out of Amanda&rsquo;s folk&rsquo;s computer last week when it turned out to be a Philips instead of some no name manufacturer. Seemed a little odd that something they made would give out in a year and a half of normal use. Turns out it may be par for the course.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/25/os_x/'><h1>OS X</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Looks like you actually can emulate a PPC on an x86 well enough to install OS X. It&rsquo;s still a little on the slow side (basic emulation results in 500:1 slowdown over the host processor, while their JIT compiler for x86 brings that up to more like 40:1 slowdown since they cache the translated code), but the project seems pretty active, and there&rsquo;s lots of room for improvement. Still pretty need to see Mac OS X running on a PC (either Windows or Linux, but I&rsquo;ve just tried Linux at this point).</p>

                <p>I must be in one heck of a blogging mood today. I saw this Slashdot post and thought it sounded pretty sweet. Turns out, they&rsquo;ve released a GPL&rsquo;d PPC emulator for x86 that is actually capable of booting OS X. Here&rsquo;s the OS-News article that includes all the pretty pictures. Sounds like it&rsquo;s still got a few problems (reviewer ran into a few infinite loop explosions once OS X had started, and it guzzles the whole CPU), but it actually kinda worked.</p>
