                <p>So apparently GCC4 should be released before too long. Release candidates are out and release date is set for some time in April. Recently found out Fedora Core 4 will include it, which made me a little wary of trying it out (seems like it took a while for the GCC3 release to settle down and for apps to fix compatibility issues). Weird thing is, I was looking through a feature comparison for OS X (Tiger.</p>

                <p>Saw this post at slashdot. Looks like the next release of OS X, 10.4 to be exact, will be released on April 29th. Supposed to be a pretty hefty update.</p>

                <p>Ack! My pants are on fire. Was just perusing the gcc website when I noticed they&rsquo;re refering to it as the GNU Compiler Collection. Hmm. Wonder if it&rsquo;s always been that way, or just since they added other languages&hellip;
Edit: Dug around their wiki some more. Looks like it used to be GNU C Compiler (at least the initial release was), just as I thought.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/02/25/misconceptions-gcc/'><h1>Misconceptions: GCC</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Don&rsquo;t know what made me think of it this morning, but I was remembering something my first programming teacher said. He was teaching a course in introductory C programming for engineering applications and we were using gcc as our compiler. At the time, he claimed GCC stood for Good C Compiler. Seems pretty suspect since the gcc most everyone knows is actually the GNU C Compiler since it&rsquo;s been developed by the GNU organization which was founded back in 1984 (although the first release of gcc wasn&rsquo;t until 1987, but that was long before I took this course).</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve switched IM clients already. Fire just wasn&rsquo;t as featureful/configurable as I would like, so I&rsquo;ve started using Adium X. Got Firefox for the pages that don&rsquo;t work right in Safari. Fink of course for additional Unix goodies (mostly extra compilation stuff). SSHKeychain provides a convenient interface to ssh-agent and simplifies key management. DoubleCommand lets me remap some keys (ie I can make my Ctrl key act like an Apple Command key), and the next version should differentiate between left and right keys allowing me to have both a Ctrl and a Command key (since Ctrl is sorta essential for emacs).</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve had the mini for a couple of days now, and so far I have to say I&rsquo;m impressed. Cute little box and so far I&rsquo;ve largely been impressed with the speed and &ldquo;fluidity&rdquo; of it. OS X seems awful slick so far, barring the inevitable learning curve. In fairly short order I&rsquo;d found the Terminal and was greeted with a familiar bash prompt and even things like emacs (text-only) and ssh out of the box.</p>

                <p>Looks like my Mac mini is finally on its way! Granted, it looks like it&rsquo;s just been picked up in China today (Shenzhen?), so it&rsquo;ll likely be a while. But still very cool!</p>

                <p>Turns out Anandtech has started providing some Mac coverage. Anand starts off with A Month with a Mac: A Die-Hard PC User&rsquo;s Perspective providing his take on the Mac experience to the &ldquo;uninitiated&rdquo; with a hefty Dual-G5 desktop. This led to the mobile experience with a Powerbook. Most recently, he&rsquo;s taken a look at the Mac mini.</p>

                <p>Macworld has lots of good coverage on the Mac mini. They&rsquo;ve got a nice review with benchmark results, discussion of some of the available options, and even some cool findings (looks like some of the 40GB machines come with 5400rpm drives instead of 4200, and some systems may come with faster RAM, but I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s actually being clocked any higher than PC2700). They&rsquo;ve got coverage on disassembly with lots of pictures (opening it up and stripping it down to bare components).</p>

                <p>Finally bit the bullet and ordered myself a Mac mini. There&rsquo;s a good 3-4 week lead time on them currently, so I still have time to back out if I get cold feet. But I&rsquo;ve been wanting a machine that&rsquo;d run OS X for some time now. Every so often I look into &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; used Macs on fleabay, but have always been thwarted by the remarkably high prices that old Macs go for.</p>
