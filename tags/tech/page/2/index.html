                <p>Apple is full of interesting surprises this year. First they announced they&rsquo;d be ditching PowerPC in favor of x86. Now, they&rsquo;ve gone and released a multibutton mouse. But without any buttons. Er&hellip; something like that.
In place of buttons, it features touch-sensitive capacitive sensors beneath the top shell (ala the iPod) that &ldquo;detect where your fingers are and predict your clicking intentions&rdquo;. Or at least that&rsquo;s according to their marketing speak.</p>

                <p>I hate stupid people. I can accept that the population at large is generally clueless about all things tech, and so I have a fairly high tolerance level when they do annoying newb things. The people that really tick me off are the ones who are clearly in a technical field (say, a whole bunch of people in academia on a FPGA research/education mailing list), and are clearly clueless about very basic concepts such as email&hellip;</p>

                <p>This is a test post from , a fancy photo sharing thing.
Pretty cool. Looks like flickr will let you upload 20M of photos per month, and makes the last 200 you&rsquo;ve posted visible. Has assorted useful features such as tagging photos, controlling who can see photos, etc. Seems pretty cool. I might just use it some for more temporary stuff (ie stuff I don&rsquo;t want to archive on the web forever and take up precious space on my webhost).</p>

                <p>Ran across this site recently. Seems pretty cool. They&rsquo;ve posted a copy of a declassified WWII US submarine manual (well, immediately following the war to be more exact), including scans of all the neat pictures/diagrams/etc and ocr&rsquo;d text.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m a little late in posting this (ISCA &lsquo;05 in Madison and all that rot), but in Steve Jobs&rsquo; keynote at Apple&rsquo;s WWDC he dropped a bombshell&hellip; Apple&rsquo;s dropping the PowerPC and switching to Intel/x86. Engadget has some analysis on the decision, but I guess it largely boils down to limitations they&rsquo;ve experienced with the PowerPC platform. To recap, Motorola had been making all the PowerPC chips for Apple until their G5 schedule didn&rsquo;t meet Apple&rsquo;s needs.</p>

                <p>As I suspected, the 10.4.1 update for Tiger has been released. Looks like they&rsquo;ve fixed quite a number of things (seems to have possibly solved some of the crashes/lockups I&rsquo;d experienced so far&hellip; at least, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve had one since I updated).</p>

                <p>So it would seem that the release of iTunes by Apple largely killed off the other music playing apps (ie mp3 players). Which is lame because I find the interface a little bulky, doesn&rsquo;t seem like I can have it sort based on directory structure, and I find it a little annoying that by default it wants to copy all of your music to a &ldquo;My Music&rdquo; type folder when you import new stuff.</p>

                <p>Looks like Tiger&rsquo;s new Dashboard could use some refinement when it comes to security. Looks like it&rsquo;s pretty trivial to make a user auto-download a widget when they visit a webpage in Safari, it&rsquo;ll then auto-install if they&rsquo;re using the default Safari settings, and then they&rsquo;ll be running a potentially very obnoxious (and possibly even malicious) widget that&rsquo;s impossible for average Joe user to remove. With any luck they&rsquo;ll refine this a bit in 10.</p>

                <p>Looks like Apples&rsquo;s released Java 1.5 for Tiger. Not quite sure why people aren&rsquo;t talking about this (was released same day as Tiger&rsquo;s &ldquo;official&rdquo; release date) since a lot of people had mentioned it being present in the Tiger developer test releases and that it was absent from the final version released to the public. Looks like I can finally see about getting Liberty&rsquo;s LSE up and running on OS X.</p>

 Adium 0.80 brings a completely new status system with available messages and invisibility on supported protocols, built-in secure encrypted messaging via Off-the-Record Messaging, the long-awaited file transfer progress interface, customizable built-in Growl notification system support, blocking, customizable service and status icons, full OS X 10.4 compatibility, and much, much more.</p>
