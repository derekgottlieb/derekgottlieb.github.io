                <p>Making progress again on the house (and remembered to bring my camera again too). A bunch of the double-paned windows that had broken seals were replaced on Tuesday (turns out some of the remaining windows were misordered and the sliding glass door is on backorder). Big improvement on the ones that have been replaced though. Will actually be able to look out the windows now. Got the light green paint up on two of the walls in the dining room (but not the overhang near the cathedral ceiling), gold along the north wall with the big picture window in the living room and the sliding glass door in the dining room that leads to the deck.</p>

                <p>Amanda and I have been pretty busy since we closed on the house. We&rsquo;ve looked at flooring some, and I&rsquo;ve started the ball rolling on fixing the windows (several of the double panes had broken seals). We&rsquo;ve also done a fair bit of painting, sanding, staining, sealing, spackling, de-wallpapering, cleaning, landscaping&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep a pretty good photo log of our progress over in the gallery. Basically, I&rsquo;ve got a full tour of the house as it was at closing, and then a separate album tracking our progress in each room.</p>

                <p>So, Amanda and I closed on the new house yesterday morning. We&rsquo;re already starting to feel like homeowners. And by that, I mean we&rsquo;ve already started tearing the place apart. :) For those that are interested, I&rsquo;ve got some pictures up over in the gallery (taken with the new Digital Rebel).</p>

                <p>Yay! My Digital Rebel just got here!!
To recap, I finally decided to break down and get myself something fun for getting my thesis deposited. Decided last week that I&rsquo;d get myself a Canon Digital Rebel EOS-300D if I could find it at a price I liked. Ended up getting it at a pretty decent price ($200-250 off what I could get it for locally). Looks like it should be a pretty sweet camera ([Review, Another).</p>

                <p>I think I&rsquo;ve got the bulk of the photos from our honeymoon in Ireland cleaned up and uploaded. You should be able to view them now here. I tried setting it up to auto-resize them when I uploaded (since I don&rsquo;t have the disk space to store them all full res), but I&rsquo;m not sure if I want them any bigger than it&rsquo;s currently set to. If you&rsquo;ve got any feedback in that respect, please let me know.</p>
