                <p>Amanda and I are buying a new house. In a land far far from CU&hellip; Huntsville, AL to be exact&hellip; or technically Madison, AL to be even more exact (suburb to the west of Huntsville).
No, Derek didn&rsquo;t graduate. While one could ask &ldquo;why is he leaving sans-degree&rdquo;, a better question might be &ldquo;why is he referring to himself in the third person?&rdquo; To put it simply, I just got fed up with how things have been going (or not going to be more precise) and decided it was time for a change.</p>

                <p>Those of you who know me should know why I haven&rsquo;t updated in a long time. Amanda and I had a very long month when we went down to Huntsville for Mike&rsquo;s wedding. We had our baby Isaac prematurely, and after fighting for three long weeks in the Huntsville NICU, he passed away peacefully in our arms. We&rsquo;re still having a hard time with it, but I suppose it&rsquo;s good to talk about it.</p>

                <p>Took some pictures of the snow yesterday and put them up on flickr:
We definitely got a fair bit of snow, and some of the drifts were pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the winds and the city plows concentrated and packed the snow on our side of the street (but it did mean our street was plowed a few times as opposed to the more minor streets that maybe saw one pass&hellip; benefits of being a city and school bus route).</p>

                <p>Day 752 of my captivity. Found what I hope is one of my captor&rsquo;s favorite possessions. It appears to be some sort of container for transporting instruments of my exploitation and I believe it to be associated with their obnoxious light flashing device.
I have thoroughly inspected it&rsquo;s contents to ascertain if it might hold anything I could use in my escape. Having found nothing, I destroyed it&rsquo;s lining with my claws and ate the outer edges to prevent its further use.</p>

                <p>Have some pics up from my trip to the bay area up at Flickr:
Was a good trip overall. Real good to see Richy and Carrie and get to hang out with them some and see some sights. Got up to the Golden Gate bridge, although didn&rsquo;t see that much since it was really foggy. Headed down to the Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf and wandered around there for a while checking out the sea lions and Ghirardelli and such.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2006/02/22/kitty-part-trois/'><h1>Kitty part trois</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>We adopted our third kitty this past Saturday thanks to Amanda&rsquo;s sister Katie. She&rsquo;d found him as a stray hanging around the house of some of her boyfriend&rsquo;s friends down in Carbondale. Seems there&rsquo;s a BIG stray cat problem down in that neck of the woods (presumably because of all the college students in the area, and their decision to ditch their cats when they move). I think the call she made to Amanda about the kitty went something like this:</p>

                <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve uploaded bits and pieces of the Chicago photos (still not quite done sifting through the stuff from the Field Museum or any of my skyline/downtown shots or those in Millenium Park). You can check them out here.</p>

                <p>This is a test post from , a fancy photo sharing thing.
Pretty cool. Looks like flickr will let you upload 20M of photos per month, and makes the last 200 you&rsquo;ve posted visible. Has assorted useful features such as tagging photos, controlling who can see photos, etc. Seems pretty cool. I might just use it some for more temporary stuff (ie stuff I don&rsquo;t want to archive on the web forever and take up precious space on my webhost).</p>
