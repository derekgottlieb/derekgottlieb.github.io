                <p>I got some more of the disposable cameras from the wedding processed. Nothing too interesting aside from a few shots of the cats I took to use up film that I&rsquo;ve put up in the usual place. Here are a couple of highlights:

Merry likes to play in the laundry
Spooky likes to play in the big soup pot Silly kitties! And now that my folks have come to visit the grand-kitties (don&rsquo;t ask&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t coin the phrase), they have all sorts of new cat toys to play with.</p>

                <p>Talked about this earlier. Managed to take some more pictures today and actually load them onto my computer (as opposed to deleting them accidently again. In addition to Optimus Prime, there were several milk carton people (only took a picture of one, but may go back for more later), a giant fork (didn&rsquo;t take a picture because I wasn&rsquo;t as enthralled by it, and it looked like it was slightly broken), a burning foosball player, and a really bizarre one involving a giant beetle pushing a dirt clod with a human fetus inside.</p>

                <p>Finally got around to loading up some of my older kitty pics that were on my other camera. They start off with Spooky attacking Space Chicken when he was a little bitty kitten, and moves on to the cats playing with each other and a box.

On a related note, I did take my camera in to work today, and I did take pictures of the cardboard sculptures in Beckman.</p>

                <p>Dropped Merry off at the vet this morning for spaying (finally). Leaving her there all alone (overnight no less) really pulled at my heartstrings. :( I&rsquo;m such a softie. I don&rsquo;t know how parents manage to drop their kids off at school for the first time.
On a related note, I finally got around to uploading some more kitty pictures. Been having hardware problems with my CompactFlash reader (took forever to get it to mount, took forever to get a directory listing, took forever to transfer the files, and some of the files were corrupted by the time they got to my computer).</p>

                <p>We adopted our second kitty this past Sunday. He is an adorable 8-week old black and white kitten. He&rsquo;s predominantly black with a little white stripe down his nose, a white chin and tummy, and white paws. As per the suggestion of his previous home (one of Amanda&rsquo;s co-workers), we&rsquo;ve decided to call him Spooky. I kept thinking of the X-Files (Fox &ldquo;Spooky&rdquo; Mulder), and he seems to spook pretty easily for a kitty as curious and fearless as he appears to be.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/12/28/christmas/'><h1>Christmas</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Had a good Christmas this year. My folks came up the Tuesday before XMas and stayed at the new house till they left this past Sunday (ie Amanda and I ran out and bought a 2nd bed the weekend before they got here). Had a pretty good visit with them and got a chance to get my Dad&rsquo;s input on some household projects.
We opened our presents to each other (Amanda, my folks, and myself) Christmas Eve&hellip; my folks and Amanda liked the panoramic photos I got from LaPayne Photography (thanks Rachel!</p>

                <p>So it seems LBB (that&rsquo;s Little Boy Blazejack) has finally come into his own. If you don&rsquo;t know him, he&rsquo;s the &ldquo;little&rdquo; brother of someone I went to high school with. Those of us who knew him always wondered if he would eventually find himself gainfully employed and at the same time doing something he enjoyed. Last I knew, I think he was getting ready to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a major in photojournalism.</p>

                <p>Well, I finally broke down and bought myself a photo printer.
I&rsquo;d been surviving until recently with a close to 10 year old, increasingly finicky laser printer. It&rsquo;s served me well, but I&rsquo;ve had paper feed issues with it for quite some time (ie years) and have been somewhat limited by its inability to make pretty color prints and its dismal speed (did I mention it was an old parallel port model).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/12/01/long-overdue/'><h1>Long overdue</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So this update is long overdue. I&rsquo;ve been really busy recently with&hellip; well, life. First there was the big annual ISCA crunch where I helped Jim get his submission from 0 to paper in less than a week. Part of that was help getting him up and running on NCSA&rsquo;s Itanium-2 cluster (Teragrid) so that he could have results to write about. The other part was helping him get an actual paper together the day of the deadline since Nick was focused on the other project he wanted to submit for.</p>

                <p>Mmmm. Wood floors. Got solid oak installed downstairs over the past couple of days. Really looks outstanding. I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of pics up at the usual place, but they simply don&rsquo;t do it justice. If you have a chance to come see, do so! :) Got an estimate for putting ceramic tile in the kitchen and bathrooms, and replacing the rest of the carpet (stairs and upstairs hall/bedrooms) with new carpet.</p>
