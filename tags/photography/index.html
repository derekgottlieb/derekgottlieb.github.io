                <p>Surprise! We&rsquo;d been up to Vanderbilt for our last clinic visit before the planned c-section and had just finished our tour of L&amp;D; and were walking to the car to head home when baby Adelaide must&rsquo;ve decided she liked the place so much she wanted to stay. Amanda&rsquo;s water broke and so we went right back in and now baby Addy&rsquo;s here! She was born @ 13:01 on the 17th and weighed in at a healthy 6 lbs 11 oz at 19 1/w inches.</p>

                <p>As a followup to my snow photos from Champaign at Christmas, here&rsquo;s a sample of a few photos documenting what it takes to shutdown much of Huntsville:</p>

                <p>Finally getting around to going through photos I&rsquo;ve taken recently and uploaded a set I took of the snow while we were in Champaign for Christmas. Here&rsquo;s a sample that I liked with Sarah chasing Rachel down the street with a snow shovel full of snow:</p>

                <p>A couple of weeks ago, we went up to Nashville and hit a number of the sights. I&rsquo;ll go ahead and split this into two posts, since I&rsquo;ve only uploaded some of the relevant photos so far. The first day, we hit their recreation of the Parthenon. Apparently, it&rsquo;s actually the second replica they&rsquo;ve built, with the first being built in 1897 to celebrate their centennial but it was only built to last 6 months.</p>

                <p>On the drive back from Savannah, Charles and I quickly stopped in to visit the Robins Air Force Base Museum of Aviation. Didn&rsquo;t spend very long there, but it wasn&rsquo;t too much out of the way for the drive back and had a chance to take a few pics. There were some more unusual planes there that I&rsquo;d meant to go back and look up info on, but obviously hadn&rsquo;t since I only just pulled the photos off my camera a few days ago with the rest of the photos from Savannah.</p>

                <p>Finally caught up with going through my photos and uploading to Flickr. Katie was in town visiting this past week (Spring Break). Aside from the holy week activities (choir tired now), one afternoon Amanda and I took off work and all three of us went to the Space &amp; Rocket Center. Lots of interesting historical NASA stuff (early V-2 rockets, Saturn V/Apollo stuff, etc), but I have to admit some of it felt a bit slapped together.</p>

                <p>Took a trip for work back in December to provide cluster training for some of the engineers at Gulfstream. Seems like we also did some very minor maintenance on the cluster we administer there. Anyway, I brought the camera along and had a chance to take a few pics while wandering around the riverfront. Only got around to pulling them off my camera today, so here they are:</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m finally getting around to sifting through some of the photos I&rsquo;ve taken over the past couple of months and uploading them to Flickr. Here&rsquo;s the one from the first batch taken at Cathedral Caverns in Scottsboro, AL:

And here are some shots I took of the Autumn trees from up on Monte Sano:

And a few shots of our pumpkins from Halloween:</p>

                <p>Apparently it&rsquo;s been a busy week for my flickr photos. I&rsquo;ve had two that were selected for inclusion in various web things.
First, one of my Ireland honeymoon photos was selected for inclusion in Schmap Dublin Third Edition (check out Literary Dublin: Trinity College). Oddly enough, it was a photo I took while we were wandering around Trinity College. Here&rsquo;s a little descriptive blurb from their website:
 Exploring a Schmap Guide is a uniquely interactive experience: maps and guide content are dynamically integrated, allowing intuitive, real-time access to reviews and photo slideshows for places of interest.</p>
