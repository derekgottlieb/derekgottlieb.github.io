                <p>Finished the final touches on my MSE paper and uploaded it to their server. I already faxed over the copyright form, so I should be good to go to head out to Anaheim in June. Pretty sweet. I&rsquo;ve got postscript and pdf versions of the paper ready to go up on my work page whenever I decide it&rsquo;s appropriate to be publicly available.
The conference should prove interesting seeing as it falls smack between the abstract and paper deadlines for MICRO&hellip; Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be in a position to worry about it at that point instead of still debugging the local data caches and getting more benchmarks up and running.</p>

                <p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy this past week, and haven&rsquo;t really had time to post. Chi-Wei checked in fixes for the bulk of the bugs I had encountered in the gui, so I&rsquo;m pretty happy. I can actually sorta use the thing now. More importantly, Jeff and I have made some comments about additional features we REALLY want, so with any luck, we&rsquo;ll actually get some of those before long.</p>

                <p>So my local data caches finally started doing stuff today. Cluster 0 requests M[0x0]. The main cache sends all words in that local cache line and informs cluster 0 that it has exclusive access. Cluster 1 then requests M[0x0]. The main cache informs Cluster 0 that the block is now shared and waits for an ACK to confirm that it hasn&rsquo;t become modified. Pretty sweet! I may actually have it all up and running before much longer.</p>

                <p>So Nick scheduled our first Amalgam meeting of the semester for today. But unfortunately, our meetings are scheduled for right before his class (which he has never taught before). As a result, he ditched our meeting to finish preparing his lecture. Nothing like getting things done early. Anyway, he dropped by around 1/2 hour before the meeting to tell Jeff and me that he wasn&rsquo;t coming and we should figure out where the project will be around the end of the semester and what conferences we should shoot for.</p>
