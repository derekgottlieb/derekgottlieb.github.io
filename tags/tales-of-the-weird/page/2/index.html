                <p>So. Was driving along last week and heard a big pow from under the hood. Knew that couldn&rsquo;t be good, and it continued to make awful sounds, so I immediately pulled over and called for a tow. Tow was pretty uneventful. Just a quick hop across town via the interstate. Went in to take care of the paperwork while the driver unloaded my car. Came back out to find the car still jacked up and with the hood popped up.</p>

                <p>So State Farm, or at least the actuarial department, has a policy that co-workers do not bring in food to help you celebrate your birthday (or any other celebration-worthy event). That would be dumb since you end up having to bring in food frequently in a large department. State Farm&rsquo;s solution: the person celebrating is expected to bring in food for the department in order to celebrate. That way, you only need to bring in food once a year (ie your own birthday).</p>

                <p>Well, since I&rsquo;ve introduced Amanda&rsquo;s co-worker Jane, I suppose I should actually start posting some of the more absurd stories about her. The first one that comes to mind I will entitle &ldquo;Jane vs. UPS.&rdquo;
One day, Jane got it into her head to send a marinated steak to a priest friend of hers in New Jersey. So she packaged up this piece of raw, marinated steak in a bowl surrounded by ice, and put this bowl in a box and taped it shut.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2003/08/04/tales_of_the_weird/'><h1>Tales of the Weird</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to add a new category. I think I&rsquo;ll title it &ldquo;Tales of the Weird&rdquo;, but for some reason I suspect simply &ldquo;Jane Stories&rdquo; would be more accurate. As such, I&rsquo;ll start this category off with a brief introduction to Jane.
For those not in the know, Jane is one of Amanda&rsquo;s co-workers over at State Farm corporate in Bloomington. Anyway, Jane is a weird little critter that should have been fired long ago, but somehow due to the ineptitude present in corporate America, continues to be paid to occupy space.</p>
