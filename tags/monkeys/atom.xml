      <description>Took a vacation of sorts down to SoFlo (hey, SoCal&amp;rsquo;s accepted, why not SoFlo for the sunshine state?) with Amanda to visit the folk this past week for Thanksgiving and Birthdays and so forth. Really spent a fair portion of my time going through the crap in my room from my childhood. Not so fun and I&amp;rsquo;m surprised Amanda didn&amp;rsquo;t kill me for wasting her limited vacation time in this manner, but at least we got to go to Monkey Jungle.</description>
