                <p>A while back Lee clued me into eMusic, a cool indie music mp3 site (subscription based, but their high-quality, mp3s unencumberd by any crappy drm). Managed to stumble over Angie Heaton who has a few albums out. Was listening to her when Amanda asked me who that was&hellip; when I told her, she said Rachel had listened to her. I took that as a cue to ask Rachel what she listened to next time I saw her.</p>

                <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve uploaded bits and pieces of the Chicago photos (still not quite done sifting through the stuff from the Field Museum or any of my skyline/downtown shots or those in Millenium Park). You can check them out here.</p>

                <p>Amanda and I just got back last night from a long weekend trip up to Chicago. Headed up there Friday morning and hit the Shedd Aquarium, apparently oldest aquarium in the country (founded 75 years ago). Since we were planning on hitting lots of museums, we picked up &ldquo;city passes&rdquo; that include admission to a number of different sites in the area (if you see more than two of the six, I think you made out well).</p>

                <p>Been rather busy lately. Went to my cousin&rsquo;s wedding 3 weekends ago in Missouri/Kansas. Then flew down to Amanda&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s wedding in Texas 2 weekends ago. My folks have been visiting this past week and just left on Sunday morning. To top that off, I&rsquo;ve had some sort of nasty sinus infection for the past week. Next weekend we&rsquo;re off to Iowa for Amanda&rsquo;s coworker&rsquo;s wedding and on the way back I&rsquo;ll be going to ISCA &lsquo;05 in Wisconsin for a few days.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few of these around town. Apparently the park district is spinning them as restoring some of the land controlled by the park district to it&rsquo;s original &ldquo;prairie&rdquo; condition. In practice, I think this largely translates to &ldquo;um, this is too much work, so we&rsquo;re just going to stop mowing some of these and put up a sign.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve always found the park district to be rather interesting around here.</p>

                <p>Looks like the Orange and Blue Observer (OBO) are at it again. When I went to drop off my Rentertainment DVDs today, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the sidewalk chalk ads everywhere for a 9mm raffle being held today on the Quad. Guess their AK-47 raffle went well enough that they decided to make some more money (and presumably make some sort of statement at the same time).</p>

                <p>Was accosted by a guy on the quad yesterday about the strangest fundraiser I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a college campus. This guy was selling raffle tickets to win an AK-47&hellip; presumably a functional one. Didn&rsquo;t probe to see if he was raising money for some &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or if he just had it lying around and wanted more beer money. Weird!</p>

                <p>Went to the Castle Theater in Bloomington yesterday with Amanda to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Really outstanding theater setup. Instead of the usual uncomfortable, cramped stadium seating, the Castle has a set of squishy couches and loveseats. Much more enjoyable experience. Raiders is such a classic.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/09/17/rant-parking/'><h1>Rant: Parking</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So as of a few weeks ago, they finally got the parking deck close enough to &ldquo;finished&rdquo; to open it. By &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, I mean the bulk of the structure is there, but they&rsquo;re still actively working on it. Like putting in the sidewalks around it, putting in the street to the south, actually building up the 1st floor interior (where all the &ldquo;retail&rdquo; is supposed to go). Oh, and of course installing the elevators.</p>
