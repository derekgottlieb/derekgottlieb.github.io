                <p>Finally getting around to going through photos I&rsquo;ve taken recently and uploaded a set I took of the snow while we were in Champaign for Christmas. Here&rsquo;s a sample that I liked with Sarah chasing Rachel down the street with a snow shovel full of snow:</p>

                <p>An occasion like Hallowe&rsquo;en, April Fool&rsquo;s, or Father&rsquo;s/Mother&rsquo;s Day. Though not categorized as an official holiday, is often used as a good occasion to get a good drunk on with friends.
&ldquo;Shit dude! It&rsquo;s Hallowe&rsquo;en, my favorite alcoholiday! Let&rsquo;s get done up as Zombies and get druuuuunk!!!&rdquo;

We were in CU this past weekend to close on the sale of our old house (yay!). Seems we hadn&rsquo;t realized it was &ldquo;Unofficial&rdquo; St.</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year. Time to watch favorites like &ldquo;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&rdquo; (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron Howard) and &ldquo;A Christmas Story&rdquo; (they looked at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears!). Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me before I had a chance to notice. Fortunately I was able to get the little bit of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as I had feared.</p>

                <p>Took some pictures of the snow yesterday and put them up on flickr:
We definitely got a fair bit of snow, and some of the drifts were pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the winds and the city plows concentrated and packed the snow on our side of the street (but it did mean our street was plowed a few times as opposed to the more minor streets that maybe saw one pass&hellip; benefits of being a city and school bus route).</p>

                <p>Apparently the UofI hasn&rsquo;t called a snow day since &lsquo;79. That&rsquo;s close to 30 years of no snow days. They had some silly spokesperson on the news last night that tried to claim we were such a hardy campus and liked to walk everywhere so it took an awful lot to shut us down. Apparently they decided that severe blizzard conditions with 45mph gusts and snow falling way faster than the plows could ever hope to keep up with might actually warrant a snow day.</p>

                <p>All classes have been canceled for Tuesday (Feb. 13) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. More than 5 inches of snow fell overnight, up to another foot of snow is possible by Tuesday night and a blizzard warning is in effect. U. of I. employees who have been designated as essential personnel are expected to report to work.

The U of I never cancels class.</p>

                <p>All Wednesday (Feb. 14) classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have been cancelled.
Continuing high winds and snow have made it impossible to keep streets and sidewalks clear and safe.
Only personnel providing critical services should continue to report for each work shift until further notice. Employees uncertain about their status should direct any questions to their supervisors.
Classes at the U. of I. Child Development Lab also are cancelled for Wednesday.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting to hear this for a while, but it&rsquo;s still a bummer to find out that The Reputation have officially broken up. In Elizabeth&rsquo;s words:
As I&rsquo;m guessing many of you have already figured out, the band is over.
Sean quit. Rest of us just gave up, I guess. I don&rsquo;t currently have plans to do any more music or play any more shows. Breaks my fucking heart.</p>

                <p>Rachel came down to visit this past weekend and we caught the show at the Courtyard Cafe Saturday night. I was really wanting to catch Elizabeth Elmore again with the rest of her band, The Reputation, and had heard they were to go on third which in theory would be around 10:30. Not wanting to miss them, I figured we should get there by 10 just to be sure, and probably got there a fair bit before that since we caught the tail end of the first act, Judah Johnson.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to it for a few weeks since I read about it, and managed to catch Elizabeth Elmore playing solo at the Courtyard Cafe in the Union. Free show no less. There were pretty clearly only a handful of people that were explicitly there to attend the show and an assortment of others that were there just eating their lunch or studying or what-not. Good show though. Just her and her electric (Gibson SG I believe).</p>
