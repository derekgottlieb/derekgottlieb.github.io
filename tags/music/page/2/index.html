                <p>Was just poking around online last night and realized The Reputation is playing in town again next week at the Canopy Club. And unfortunately I&rsquo;ve also realized Amanda and I are going to a Madrigal dinner at ISU in Bloomington that same night. Oh well. I&rsquo;ll get to see them some day I hope. :(</p>

                <p>Took a vacation of sorts down to SoFlo (hey, SoCal&rsquo;s accepted, why not SoFlo for the sunshine state?) with Amanda to visit the folk this past week for Thanksgiving and Birthdays and so forth. Really spent a fair portion of my time going through the crap in my room from my childhood. Not so fun and I&rsquo;m surprised Amanda didn&rsquo;t kill me for wasting her limited vacation time in this manner, but at least we got to go to Monkey Jungle.</p>

                <p>So I broke down and bought a new mp3 player to take with me when I go jogging&hellip; well jogging/walking&hellip; well really more walking than jogging, but I&rsquo;m still building up toward that. Anyway, looks like it should be a pretty cute little unit. Key features:
 It&rsquo;s about a 1&quot; cube has a little OLED display comes in 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB versions (I got the 512) has an FM radio (can even record it at up to 160kbps) 8-10 hours of battery life when playing mp3s USB2.</p>

                <p>A while back Lee clued me into eMusic, a cool indie music mp3 site (subscription based, but their high-quality, mp3s unencumberd by any crappy drm). Managed to stumble over Angie Heaton who has a few albums out. Was listening to her when Amanda asked me who that was&hellip; when I told her, she said Rachel had listened to her. I took that as a cue to ask Rachel what she listened to next time I saw her.</p>

                <p>So it would seem that the release of iTunes by Apple largely killed off the other music playing apps (ie mp3 players). Which is lame because I find the interface a little bulky, doesn&rsquo;t seem like I can have it sort based on directory structure, and I find it a little annoying that by default it wants to copy all of your music to a &ldquo;My Music&rdquo; type folder when you import new stuff.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/26/song-lyrics/'><h1>Song Lyrics</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Got a couple of song lyrics related websites for you. I rarely have a clue what the artist/author means when they create something, be it abstract painting, poetry, or song lyrics. So I found songmeanings.net of some interest. On a related note, have you ever heard little kids singing a song (or the pledge of allegience). As a group, they usually sound about right, but if you listen to them individually, you hear some rather bizarre stuff that sounds about right, but is totally wrong.</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been drooling over new MP3 players recently. There&rsquo;s been all sorts of activity in iPod-land. You&rsquo;ve got the 4th gen iPods that bump battery life up to ~12 hours per charge. You&rsquo;ve got the U2 Special Edition iPod that comes in a snazzy black color scheme with a sharply contrasting red click-wheel, band member autographs engraved on the back, and a $50 iTunes coupon good toward the purchase of &ldquo;The Complete U2&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m guessing that only partially covers the price of admission, and isn&rsquo;t all that great a deal since they&rsquo;ve bumped up the price of the unit by $50).</p>

                <p>Looks like the DI did actually send a photographer to the Evanescence concert&hellip; they just never bothered to publish a story or any photos about it until now. Basically, they&rsquo;ve got a feature on the DI Finest Photos of 2004 (little presumptuous seeing as the year&rsquo;s not even half over). But apparently, they thought this photo of Evanescence was one of their best of the year. Why it wouldn&rsquo;t have warranted publishing earlier on that basis, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

                <p>So Richy had some nice news for me. Turns out somebody managed to get a high quality bootleg of Monday&rsquo;s concert up by Tuesday afternoon. Quality&rsquo;s quite good, so you may want to check it out. Also, Richy&rsquo;s got his pictures up from the concert now. You can see them here.</p>

                <p>So Amanda and I (along with Richy, Carrie, Lee, and Dan) went to the Ben Folds concert last night at Foellinger. The show was great! The opening act was a great string trio led by David Berkeley on guitar, and assisted by Will Robertson on upright bass and Adam Buchwald(?) on mandolin. They were really good. I loved the mix of the 3 instruments. You should definitely check out David Berkeley if you get the chance (there&rsquo;s a mp3 available for download on his page of a song &ldquo;Fire Sign&rdquo; that was featured in CBS' show Without a Trace).</p>
