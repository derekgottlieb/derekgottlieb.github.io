                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/02/26/evanescence/'><h1>Evanescence</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I saw Evanescence in concert this past Tuesday at the Assembly Hall. Great show.
First opening act, Atomship, was kinda eh. They weren&rsquo;t awful, but they certainly weren&rsquo;t very good either. Lead singer was pretty weird. Had something vaguely resembling a British accent until he mentioned they were from Mississippi when he suddenly reverted to a good ol' boy accent. And he had this weird twitchy, seizurey sort of &ldquo;dance&rdquo; thing.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2003/12/02/liz_phair_followup/'><h1>Liz Phair followup</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Just wanted to post a quick followup to my previous Liz Phair post. Found this pretty cool shot of her performing at Foellinger (courtesy of the Daily Illini).
I lost count, but I believe she rotated between 3 Fender electrics and some sort of acoustic during the course of the show with her roadie retuning between swaps. She claimed she had to swap out guitars a lot because he would have to retune depending on the song.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2003/11/18/liz_phair/'><h1>Liz Phair</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Yeah, so things have been pretty busy the past several months, and I haven&rsquo;t made any posts here since the fall semester started. Anyway, just wanted to pop on here to say I went to the Liz Phair concert last night and it rocked. Quite outstanding. If you haven&rsquo;t heard her stuff, and like &ldquo;chick rock&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d suggest checking her out. Her most recent album is more pop than her older stuff.</p>
