                <p>I&rsquo;ve been a happy happy joy joy subscriber at eMusic since 2005. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I thought initially when Lee clued me into it (indie music being a new thing for me), but after that first month I was hooked. Took me a few months and then I bumped up to the annual subscription option. Until recently, my most recent subscription plan worked out to $16/month, which got me 90 tracks a month.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting to hear this for a while, but it&rsquo;s still a bummer to find out that The Reputation have officially broken up. In Elizabeth&rsquo;s words:
 As I&rsquo;m guessing many of you have already figured out, the band is over.
Sean quit. Rest of us just gave up, I guess. I don&rsquo;t currently have plans to do any more music or play any more shows. Breaks my fucking heart.</p>

                <p>Rachel came down to visit this past weekend and we caught the show at the Courtyard Cafe Saturday night. I was really wanting to catch Elizabeth Elmore again with the rest of her band, The Reputation, and had heard they were to go on third which in theory would be around 10:30. Not wanting to miss them, I figured we should get there by 10 just to be sure, and probably got there a fair bit before that since we caught the tail end of the first act, Judah Johnson.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to it for a few weeks since I read about it, and managed to catch Elizabeth Elmore playing solo at the Courtyard Cafe in the Union. Free show no less. There were pretty clearly only a handful of people that were explicitly there to attend the show and an assortment of others that were there just eating their lunch or studying or what-not. Good show though. Just her and her electric (Gibson SG I believe).</p>

                <p>I guess I&rsquo;ve been swimming in bad karma or something lately. First, I broke the nice set of Sennheiser HD515 cans I use at work leaving me with the craptacular closed Aiwas I&rsquo;d used before seeing the light. Then, I broke the belt clip on my cellphone. Fortunately, superglue seems to have solved both problems.
Then, I realized my Thinkpad wasn&rsquo;t charging like it should. Everything indicated it was charging, but the battery meter kept getting lower.</p>

                <p>Rachel and her roommate Tammy (who&rsquo;s a hoot btw) came down Friday night to catch the show at the Canopy Club featuring The Living Blue, Tractor Kings, Dark Country, and The Dolphin. We showed up some time during the Dolphin&rsquo;s set and all I have to say is weird. I couldn&rsquo;t really tell whether they were playing something or just getting setup and making random noises on-stage. We elected to wait out at the bar until after their set was over.</p>

                <p>Lee and I trekked up to Chicago to catch The New Pornographers / Belle &amp; Sebastian play at the Riviera Friday night.
I handled travel plans (directions to the Park&amp;Ride; station where we parked and caught the &ldquo;L&rdquo;, trains to take, transfers to make, how to get to the theater, last train we&rsquo;d have to catch). Pretty uneventful trip for the most part. The most interesting part was how the bike lane to the side of the road in Chicago was used as a thug passing lane by many.</p>

                <p>Caught Andrew Bird last night with Lee at the Canopy Club. Impressive live show. I was really amazed how much can come out of so few people. If you&rsquo;ve never heard Andrew Bird, his music has lots going on. Very melodic. The show (and presumably his album too) was performed by two people using slick audio equipment. They&rsquo;d play several measures on one instrument, loop it, then play along to it with other stuff.</p>

                <p>Finally got to see The Reputation live&hellip; and they rocked! Went to see them last night with Lee at Cowboy Monkey here in CU and they were fantastic. Great show. Can&rsquo;t beat the price either. $8 cover for 3 bands playing a 45 minute set each. And Lee and I were right up there by the stage. Couldn&rsquo;t get much closer without completely losing my hearing. :) A good time was definitely had by all.</p>
