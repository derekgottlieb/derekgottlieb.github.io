                <p>Fairly recently, the company that made our group fileserver was bought up by Sun. So we&rsquo;re not really sure whether we&rsquo;ll be able to renew our service contract (which runs out October 20th), or if we&rsquo;ll be forced to buy a new Sun fileserver at a discount. The cynic in all of us should know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip;
On Friday, our group fileserver sorta flaked. Took the admins an hour or more to get it back up and running, and when it did our current group mount (ie the one with all the stuff I really care about right now) did not come up with it.</p>

                <p>Was just down to the basement in CSL to buy a soda only to find they&rsquo;ve jacked the 20oz price up to $1.25. Lame. They don&rsquo;t provide us with free espresso-based beverages, they don&rsquo;t provide us with a convenient places to buy espresso-based beverages, and now they&rsquo;re mugging us on the sodas. How are grad students supposed to work into the wee hours without a cheap source of caffeine? :( Might have to just start bringing my own.</p>

                <p>I hate stupid people. I can accept that the population at large is generally clueless about all things tech, and so I have a fairly high tolerance level when they do annoying newb things. The people that really tick me off are the ones who are clearly in a technical field (say, a whole bunch of people in academia on a FPGA research/education mailing list), and are clearly clueless about very basic concepts such as email&hellip;</p>

                <p>I hate stupid people. Amanda and I were enjoying a nice dinner at Nitaya Thai last night when this flock of heathens came in. I knew they were heathens because they promptly asked for a kids' menu. Where do they think they were&hellip; Denny&rsquo;s? Gets worse from there. When they find out there&rsquo;s no kids' menu, they&rsquo;re youngest broodling has the nerve to confront the waitress with a loud, finger-quoted &ldquo;what do you mean no kids' menu?</p>

                <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be complaining about how hot it is in winter. Truth be told, it&rsquo;s ass cold outside. But when I came into the office today it was close to 90 degrees in there! I&rsquo;ve propped the door open and tried to get in touch with Dan the friendly building manager guy any way possible. I think they&rsquo;ve tweaked something since it&rsquo;s started to come down (about 86 now), but it&rsquo;s taking a while.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/09/17/rant-parking/'><h1>Rant: Parking</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So as of a few weeks ago, they finally got the parking deck close enough to &ldquo;finished&rdquo; to open it. By &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, I mean the bulk of the structure is there, but they&rsquo;re still actively working on it. Like putting in the sidewalks around it, putting in the street to the south, actually building up the 1st floor interior (where all the &ldquo;retail&rdquo; is supposed to go). Oh, and of course installing the elevators.</p>

                <p>Got two rants today. First off, what is up with FedEx? I bought something online that was shipped via 3-day FedEx. Estimated delivery is for tomorrow (to hit the 3-day deadline). Well, turns out they had it sitting in their local office this morning before they pack up the trucks for the day&rsquo;s deliveries. But since I had only paid for 3-day, they decided to leave it sitting on the dock to be delivered tomorrow so that I&rsquo;d know what I was missing out on by not going with 2-day.</p>

                <p>So I have officially sworn off Philips. Not the screwdriver, the electronic manufacturer. I was a little confused when I pulled the dead/flaky CDRW/DVD drive out of Amanda&rsquo;s folk&rsquo;s computer last week when it turned out to be a Philips instead of some no name manufacturer. Seemed a little odd that something they made would give out in a year and a half of normal use. Turns out it may be par for the course.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/14/a4_paper/'><h1>A4 paper</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I finally have the remotest clue what the deal is with A4 paper (and as a result why the rest of the world feels the need to use it and screw up my print jobs, and make life difficult in LaTeX sometimes). Basically, there&rsquo;s a slashdot post on it that points to this page that discusses some of the ideas behind why A4 is the size it is. Apparently all metric paper has a height-to-width ratio of the square root of 2.</p>
