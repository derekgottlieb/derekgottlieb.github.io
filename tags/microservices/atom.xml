      <description>As part of developing RESTful HTTP APIs at work, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of discussion over the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; way to architect/implement everything. To avoid relying strictly on my own instincts and relearning mistakes that many others have already learned from, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Building Microservices. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it yet, but have gotten a lot out of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far (and been pleased to see that my instincts have been largely supported by someone who&amp;rsquo;s experienced implementing such systems).</description>
