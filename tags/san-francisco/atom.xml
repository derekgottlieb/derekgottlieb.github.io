      <description>Have some pics up from my trip to the bay area up at Flickr:

Was a good trip overall. Real good to see Richy and Carrie and get to hang out with them some and see some sights. Got up to the Golden Gate bridge, although didn&amp;rsquo;t see that much since it was really foggy. Headed down to the Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf and wandered around there for a while checking out the sea lions and Ghirardelli and such.</description>
