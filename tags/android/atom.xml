      <description>&lt;p&gt;My foray into the world of Android phones is finally at an end, and am now the
owner of a shiny iPhone 4S.  It was an interesting experiment, and there were a
few features that I will miss that I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a way to do on the iPhone,
but the Android experience finally got bad enough (and I hit my 2 year contract
anniversary) to push for a phone upgrade at work.  There were just too many
issues with my Droid and Android in general from a usability standpoint to
suffer it any further.  Issues with the Android ecosystem (at least as I&amp;rsquo;ve
been able to experience it&amp;hellip; maybe 4.0 will really start to address some of
their problems):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last November, I finally got a smartphone (through work no less).  Gotta
love not having to pay that monthly phone+data bill.  The iPhone always had a
lot of appeal to me, but the thought of having to switch to AT&amp;amp;T wasn&amp;rsquo;t
especially attractive to me.  I&amp;rsquo;m not big on the restrictions Verizon usually
places on their phones (let&amp;rsquo;s disable all the features of your phone out so we
can force you to use an expensive VZW service instead and nickle-and-dime you
to death).  But it&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat their coverage.  Long story short (too late),
I ended up with a Motorola Droid running Google&amp;rsquo;s Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
