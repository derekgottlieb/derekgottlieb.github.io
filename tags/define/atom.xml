      <description>An occasion like Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en, April Fool&amp;rsquo;s, or Father&amp;rsquo;s/Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day. Though not categorized as an official holiday, is often used as a good occasion to get a good drunk on with friends.
&amp;ldquo;Shit dude! It&amp;rsquo;s Hallowe&amp;rsquo;en, my favorite alcoholiday! Let&amp;rsquo;s get done up as Zombies and get druuuuunk!!!&amp;rdquo;

      <description>In ethology, zugunruhe is anxious behavior in migratory animals that are prevented from migrating, especially in birds. When these animals are enclosed, they exhibit this behaviour during the seasons in which they normally migrate. Behaviourists have been able to study the endocrine controls and navigational mechanisms associated with migration from studying zugunruhe.
This term is German in origin and is a compound of Zug (move, migration) and Unruhe (anxiety, restlessness).</description>

Apparently the park district is spinning them as restoring some of the land controlled by the park district to it&amp;rsquo;s original &amp;ldquo;prairie&amp;rdquo; condition. In practice, I think this largely translates to &amp;ldquo;um, this is too much work, so we&amp;rsquo;re just going to stop mowing some of these and put up a sign.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve always found the park district to be rather interesting around here.</description>

  To understand, usually in a global sense. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. Contrast zen, which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash. See also glark.
  Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding. &amp;ldquo;Almost all C compilers grok the &amp;ldquo;void&amp;rdquo; type these days.</description>

      <description>According to BJ, a glibbet is a small, weasel-like animal. Unfortunately, I have been unable to confirm this is a legit word. Most of the references I have found on the web state that it&amp;rsquo;s a nonsense, made-up word. BJ&amp;rsquo;s convinced it&amp;rsquo;s legit, but I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s just a word his favorite author made up for one of his books. I could be wrong though. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask Amanda&amp;rsquo;s mom and see if she actually confirmed this word somewhere, or if BJ just showed it to her in one of his books.</description>
