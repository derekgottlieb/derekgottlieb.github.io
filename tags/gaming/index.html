                <p>So recently I&rsquo;d been thinking a fair bit about how good some old DOS games were back in the day. The ones that really came to mind were the Ultima series (particularly U6: The False Prophet, U7: The Black Gate, and U7: Serpent Isle). Those were outstanding games. I&rsquo;d done a bit of research and found DOSBox, which allows you to play a wide range of old DOS games on an assortment of platforms (ie it performs x86/DOS emulation).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/09/28/zelda-delayed/'><h1>Zelda delayed :(</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>How lame! I&rsquo;ve talked about this game a little previously, and it&rsquo;s looking pretty oustanding. They&rsquo;ve gone back to more of a realistic look from the cel-shaded cartoony stuff of Wind Waker. Not that Wind Waker wasn&rsquo;t cool. But it sounds like it&rsquo;s getting pushed back from November to some time after next March or so (according to IGN). Man, this was announced back in August. Where was I? I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this game too.</p>

                <p>Nintendo&rsquo;s finally announced the controller for their next-gen console (the Revolution). Does anyone besides me find it bizarre?

Sounds like it&rsquo;s somewhere between a one-handed tv remote and an old power glove? There are apparently a couple of sensors placed near the tv plus a sensor in the remote that detect position and orientation. They plan on supporting other &ldquo;more traditional&rdquo; controller types (conventional controller shells, dance mats, bongos, etc) by slipping the remote inside these other add-ons.</p>

                <p>The big E3 entertainment expo featured the first real info on the next generation game consoles. Xbox360 features a PowerPC with 3 cores, graphics by ATI, some backwards compatibility. PS3 features a beastly PowerPC-based Cell processor (ie roughly twice the flops of the Xbox360), graphics by Nvidia, Blu-Ray support, and full backwards compatibility (PS1 and PS2). Very limited details on the Nintendo Revolution: backwards compatible with Gamecube games, support for downloading old school Nintendo games (NES, SNES, N64&hellip; not sure how the pricing scheme will work for this).</p>

                <p>So Lego&rsquo;s working on a video game set in the Lego Star Wars universe (ie Star Wars setting, but stuff is built out of Legos). They have some coverage over at Gamespot, including screenshots. Looks like it should be a pretty cute game, and the initial hands-on demo is impressive.</p>

                <p>Looks like someone heard me. There&rsquo;s now a mod out there for Doom 3 that attaches a small flashlight to the shotgun and machinegun. Claims to be using Duct Tape.</p>

                <p>Looks like EA has pushed back the release of Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault to some time in November. Guess they&rsquo;re adding some form of squad control (basic orders like advance, fall back, suppressive fire, etc) and some general polishing.</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been playing Doom 3 off and on most of this week. If you like the Doom series, this is a welcome refresher. The graphics are pretty tight (although I don&rsquo;t actually have a machine set up that&rsquo;s fast enough to really crank it up beyond the lowest possible settings&hellip; I do have most of the effects like bump mapping and stuff turned on though). Gameplay is pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect from a Doom game, but I kinda like the combo of the dark environment and having to use a flashlight (which looks pretty damn good).</p>
