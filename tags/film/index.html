                <p>Your Movie Buff Quotient: 88%
You are a movie buff of the most obsessive variety. If a movie exists, chances are that you&rsquo;ve seen it.
You&rsquo;re an expert on movie facts and trivia. It&rsquo;s hard to stump you with a question about film.
Are You a Movie Buff?
Response from anyone who knows me:
 well, duh. of course you&rsquo;re a movie geek.

                <p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to describe Joost aside from on-demand, internet tv clips from the crew that put together Skype and Kazaa. A while back I managed to land an invite from Joost for their private beta test, and have enjoyed running it on my Macbook Pro (they support Windows and Intel Macs at this point). Very little lag when you first fire up a program, and haven&rsquo;t had any issues once a show starts.</p>

                <p>So the Simpsons are headed for movie theaters everywhere toward the end of the month. Supposedly it&rsquo;s good, but I think I&rsquo;ll wait for the rental. What prompts me to write this post however is one of the features available on the movie website&hellip; create your own Simpsons avatar! Reasonably well done Flash affair where you select body type, hairstyle, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There&rsquo;s of course only a limited number of each of these, but you can achieve a fairly reasonable likeness and save it out as a jpeg.</p>

                <p>Took a vacation of sorts down to SoFlo (hey, SoCal&rsquo;s accepted, why not SoFlo for the sunshine state?) with Amanda to visit the folk this past week for Thanksgiving and Birthdays and so forth. Really spent a fair portion of my time going through the crap in my room from my childhood. Not so fun and I&rsquo;m surprised Amanda didn&rsquo;t kill me for wasting her limited vacation time in this manner, but at least we got to go to Monkey Jungle.</p>

                <p>Holy crap! There&rsquo;s an Aeon Flux movie in the works! Live action no less! Used to watch this way back in the day on MTV&rsquo;s Liquid Television in the middle of the night&hellip; Wild, bizarre, risque stuff.
Be sure to go check out the trailer. I really don&rsquo;t remember the show having quite that much plot. :)</p>

                <p>Finally got around to integrating my movies page with the rest of the site. It&rsquo;s definitely hacky at this point (made a custom wordpress page style containing most of the php code and simply created an empty page that uses that style), but at least it works. Still need to refine it some. I stripped out most of the db fields from getting displayed since I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t have as much screen width to work with, but I should fine tune what I display.</p>

                <p>Just decided to go poking around the web to see if there was any news about a DVD release of Kenneth Branaugh&rsquo;s Hamlet. Turns out there is! Warner Home Video is slated to release a 10th anniversary special edition DVD in 2006! Kick-ass!</p>

                <p>Star Wars: Episode III is out! And it&rsquo;s supposed to be good. Very dark, but good. I&rsquo;ve heard it actually does a good job wrapping things up and bridging the new with the old. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to see it before too long (headed out of town to go to Amanda&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s wedding tomorrow and my folks will be here next week). Of course, I&rsquo;ve heard a fairly high quality work print has been leaked.</p>

                <p>Looks like the trailer for Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Serenity (based on the series Firefly) is finally online! Looks pretty tight. How am I gonna make it till September 30th when it&rsquo;s finally released? Makes me want to go back and rewatch the show again.</p>

                <p>TV on DVD is so very cool. After a recommendation from Lee (not to mention my own curiosity), I rented the first disc of Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly a few weeks back. Really enjoyed it, so I ended up buying it. Good stuff.
Sticking with the trend, I decided to go rent the first couple of discs for BBC&rsquo;s MI-5. It had piqued my interest previously, but hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to looking for it until the recent issue of Wired reminded me.</p>
