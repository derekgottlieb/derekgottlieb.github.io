                <p>Went to the Castle Theater in Bloomington yesterday with Amanda to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Really outstanding theater setup. Instead of the usual uncomfortable, cramped stadium seating, the Castle has a set of squishy couches and loveseats. Much more enjoyable experience. Raiders is such a classic.</p>

                <p>Just saw a trailer for The Grudge with SMG. Looks excellently creepy! Man. I&rsquo;m gonna have to go see that. Makes me want to go watch The Ring, another creepy Japanese movie remake (haven&rsquo;t actually gotten around to seeing it yet, just heard about it).</p>

                <p>I can&rsquo;t wait! Season 3 of Alias will be released on DVD tomorrow. Think I&rsquo;ll break down and pick up the first two seasons while I&rsquo;m at it (only borrowed them from Richy previously). Probably need to go back and re-watch a bit of Season 2 to remember where things left off. Unfortunately, Season 4 won&rsquo;t start until January. :(</p>

                <p>Angry Alien has a series of WebToons that are popular movies in 30 seconds&hellip; re-enacted by bunnies.</p>

                <p>Who can forget the Happy Tree Friends when they&rsquo;re talking about bizarre little WebToons? The series consists of a bunch of shorts of little cute fuzzy animals meeting their demise in a disturbing manner. Fun for the whole family. I also ran across this site that appeared to have all of the episodes available for convenient viewing (I don&rsquo;t think the official site has all of the older ones). These toons have even come out on DVD if you can believe it (that&rsquo;s how I first saw them).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/08/06/the_screensavers/'><h1>The Screensavers</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been pretty religiously watching The Screensavers on G4/TechTV since I noticed the cable company added it to the lineup. Pretty entertaining show, and they sometimes have some cool bits on there. This past week they had a Best of: Free and Cheap episode detailing a number of free/cheap downloads and tips. I found a couple of segments of particular interest:
Linksys WRT54G - a lot of the Linksys network hardware runs Linux, and so they&rsquo;ve had to release the source under GPL.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/19/webtoons_amy_winfrey/'><h1>WebToons: Amy Winfrey</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So recently I&rsquo;ve been watching some webtoons done by Amy Winfrey (works as an animator for South Park), and they&rsquo;re pretty cute. I started watching her current toon, Making Fiends, that revolves around two little girls, Vendetta and Charlotte, who go to school together. Vendetta makes all sorts of fiends and attempts to intimidate and destroy Charlotte, while Charlotte&rsquo;s busy making friends. That led me to her previous set of toons, MuffinFilms, which are a variety of short animations involving muffins.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/04/02/define_mcguffin/'><h1>#define McGuffin</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>McGuffin (aka: MacGuffin or maguffin) is a term for a plot enabling device, i.e. a device or plot element in a movie that is deliberately placed to catch the viewer&rsquo;s attention and/or drive the logic of the plot, but which actually serves no further purpose - it won&rsquo;t pop up again later, it won&rsquo;t explain the ending, it won&rsquo;t actually do anything except possibly distract you while you try to figure out its significance.</p>
