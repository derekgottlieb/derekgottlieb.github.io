      <description>Those of you who know me should know why I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated in a long time. Amanda and I had a very long month when we went down to Huntsville for Mike&amp;rsquo;s wedding. We had our baby Isaac prematurely, and after fighting for three long weeks in the Huntsville NICU, he passed away peacefully in our arms. We&amp;rsquo;re still having a hard time with it, but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s good to talk about it.</description>
