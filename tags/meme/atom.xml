You are a movie buff of the most obsessive variety. If a movie exists, chances are that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it.
You&amp;rsquo;re an expert on movie facts and trivia. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to stump you with a question about film.

Response from anyone who knows me:
well, duh. of course you&amp;rsquo;re a movie geek.</description>

      <description>Kait (aka student dr. blaze) pinged me for an internet meme she filled out. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I know many people with blogs, I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll have to tap Richy and see if he&amp;rsquo;ll fill it out and pass it on.
WERE YOU NAMED AFTER ANYONE? No WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CRIED? Saturday DO YOU LIKE YOUR HANDWRITING? Yes, but I wish I could find a pen I like that&amp;rsquo;d allow me to write even smaller while maintaining legibility WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LUNCH MEAT?</description>

      <description>So the Simpsons are headed for movie theaters everywhere toward the end of the month. Supposedly it&amp;rsquo;s good, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll wait for the rental. What prompts me to write this post however is one of the features available on the movie website&amp;hellip; create your own Simpsons avatar! Reasonably well done Flash affair where you select body type, hairstyle, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s of course only a limited number of each of these, but you can achieve a fairly reasonable likeness and save it out as a jpeg.</description>
