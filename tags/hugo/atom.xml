      <description>Finally got around to migrating the blog from Jekyll/Octopress to Hugo. I managed to preserve the RSS feed URL, so it was a fairly smooth migration aside from a blip when feed readers thought all the posts were new again it. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got some work tweaking the theme and category/tag pages, but seems to be working out pretty well.</description>

      <description>Welp. Seems I forgot to test out my RSS feeds in Hugo, so I&amp;rsquo;m reverting to Octopress until I have time to sort that out.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I&amp;rsquo;d migrated from Wordpress to a static site generator for my blog as part of migrating off a shared web host to a VPS. I&amp;rsquo;d started with Octopress since it had been getting a fair bit of buzz at the time. I was pretty happy with the rendered output, but the underlying software had its flaws. The author (Brandon Mathis) highlighted some of those flaws in his post on the road to Octopress 3.</description>
