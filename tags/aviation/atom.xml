      <description>On the drive back from Savannah, Charles and I quickly stopped in to visit the Robins Air Force Base Museum of Aviation. Didn&amp;rsquo;t spend very long there, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much out of the way for the drive back and had a chance to take a few pics. There were some more unusual planes there that I&amp;rsquo;d meant to go back and look up info on, but obviously hadn&amp;rsquo;t since I only just pulled the photos off my camera a few days ago with the rest of the photos from Savannah.</description>
