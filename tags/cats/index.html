                <p>My masters have hauled me down to this strange new land they keep referring to as The South. It seems like I&rsquo;ve been hear for ages, which is apparently just long enough for them to inflict me with a bladder infection. I felt so uncomfortable I showed them who&rsquo;s boss by peeing in things to anger them, and figured they&rsquo;d break them any moment. Since they hadn&rsquo;t made me better, I figured I had to be more blunt with these simpletons and started going to the litter box every fifteen minutes and I even stooped so low as to drag my ass on the carpet like a filthy dog.</p>

                <p>Ran across this site recently, and I&rsquo;m not sure I could describe it any better than the site itself does:
Who would have guessed that when you remove Garfield from the Garfield comic strips, the result is an even better comic about schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the empty desperation of modern life? Friends, meet Jon Arbuckle. Let’s laugh and learn with him on a journey deep into the tortured mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness in a quiet American suburb.</p>

                <p>They give me a little taste, and then take it away. I can&rsquo;t take this kind of abuse. I just need my tasty kibbles. Aaah! Can&rsquo;t they hear me begging for one more hit?
Tried to work out some of my energy leaping at the fun string that makes the light come on. Can you believe they left the lid to the washer open? They&rsquo;re out to get me. I just can&rsquo;t stand the pressure.</p>

                <p>Day 746 of my captivity. My captors continued to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal.
The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from clawing the furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant.
Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded.</p>

Uploaded some new kitty pictures to flickr. Some cute pics of Sammy lounging in the laundry hamper and Spooky lounging on our bed. Spooky&rsquo;s getting so big!</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2006/02/22/kitty-part-trois/'><h1>Kitty part trois</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>We adopted our third kitty this past Saturday thanks to Amanda&rsquo;s sister Katie. She&rsquo;d found him as a stray hanging around the house of some of her boyfriend&rsquo;s friends down in Carbondale. Seems there&rsquo;s a BIG stray cat problem down in that neck of the woods (presumably because of all the college students in the area, and their decision to ditch their cats when they move). I think the call she made to Amanda about the kitty went something like this:</p>

                <p>I got some more of the disposable cameras from the wedding processed. Nothing too interesting aside from a few shots of the cats I took to use up film that I&rsquo;ve put up in the usual place. Here are a couple of highlights:
Merry likes to play in the laundry
Spooky likes to play in the big soup pot Silly kitties! And now that my folks have come to visit the grand-kitties (don&rsquo;t ask&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t coin the phrase), they have all sorts of new cat toys to play with.</p>
