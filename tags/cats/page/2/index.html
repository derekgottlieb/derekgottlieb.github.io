                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/04/26/older-kitty-pics/'><h1>Older kitty pics</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Finally got around to loading up some of my older kitty pics that were on my other camera. They start off with Spooky attacking Space Chicken when he was a little bitty kitten, and moves on to the cats playing with each other and a box.
On a related note, I did take my camera in to work today, and I did take pictures of the cardboard sculptures in Beckman. Unfortunately, when I went to download them onto my computer I accidently deleted them instead of downloading them (bit of a usability issue with Picasa IMHO).</p>

                <p>Dropped Merry off at the vet this morning for spaying (finally). Leaving her there all alone (overnight no less) really pulled at my heartstrings. :( I&rsquo;m such a softie. I don&rsquo;t know how parents manage to drop their kids off at school for the first time.
On a related note, I finally got around to uploading some more kitty pictures. Been having hardware problems with my CompactFlash reader (took forever to get it to mount, took forever to get a directory listing, took forever to transfer the files, and some of the files were corrupted by the time they got to my computer).</p>

                <p>Our kitties are silly! Apparently, one of our fuzzy blankets reminds Spooky an awful lot of his mama, because he&rsquo;s taken to kneading, suckling, and lapping on it. I was petting him this morning (in an attempt to keep him from completely waking me up) when he started in on the blanket. He had to be going at that thing for at least half an hour. Silly kitty.
Even worse&hellip; Miss Merry was getting a little old when we adopted her, but I thought vaccinations should be top priority.</p>

                <p>Took Spooky into the vet today (now that his course of antibiotics is completed), and he is a healthy little kitty. Both kitties have now had their vaccinations: Merry has had the full set of rabies and FVRCP shots, and Spooky had his first dose of the FVRCP today. I&rsquo;ll have to take him back in another month for the FVRCP booster, and then a month or two after that for rabies.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/01/11/kitty-part-deux/'><h1>Kitty part deux</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>We adopted our second kitty this past Sunday. He is an adorable 8-week old black and white kitten. He&rsquo;s predominantly black with a little white stripe down his nose, a white chin and tummy, and white paws. As per the suggestion of his previous home (one of Amanda&rsquo;s co-workers), we&rsquo;ve decided to call him Spooky. I kept thinking of the X-Files (Fox &ldquo;Spooky&rdquo; Mulder), and he seems to spook pretty easily for a kitty as curious and fearless as he appears to be.</p>

                <p>Had a good Christmas this year. My folks came up the Tuesday before XMas and stayed at the new house till they left this past Sunday (ie Amanda and I ran out and bought a 2nd bed the weekend before they got here). Had a pretty good visit with them and got a chance to get my Dad&rsquo;s input on some household projects.
We opened our presents to each other (Amanda, my folks, and myself) Christmas Eve&hellip; my folks and Amanda liked the panoramic photos I got from LaPayne Photography (thanks Rachel!</p>

                <p>So slashdot had an interesting IT review link today: Juvenile felis catus (or &ldquo;kitten&rdquo; for you laymen). Full of very cute pictures, a lot of tongue-in-cheek commentary, and links to all sorts of amusing/geeky/just plain weird sites (standard kitten package and CAT Users&rsquo; Manual). Oh, and he even provides a convenient summary comparison against competing models (i.e. puppies, babies, or a new video card). Now that Amanda and I have a house, we&rsquo;ll get to start looking for kittens before long.</p>
