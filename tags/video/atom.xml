      <description>Who can forget the Happy Tree Friends when they&amp;rsquo;re talking about bizarre little WebToons? The series consists of a bunch of shorts of little cute fuzzy animals meeting their demise in a disturbing manner. Fun for the whole family. I also ran across this site that appeared to have all of the episodes available for convenient viewing (I don&amp;rsquo;t think the official site has all of the older ones). These toons have even come out on DVD if you can believe it (that&amp;rsquo;s how I first saw them).</description>

      <description>So I ran across this post over at adland about the Quiznos Sponge Monkeys. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering where on earth they came up with those brilliant, bizarre, singing critters. So freakin&amp;rsquo; hilarious. Anyway, the ads are done by this guy as demonstrated by this other webshort of his about the moon. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like everyone over at adland appreciates them though&amp;hellip; since they seem to have confused the little furry critters with rats which they don&amp;rsquo;t think are appropriate in food ads&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>WebToons: Amy Winfrey</title>

      <description>So recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching some webtoons done by Amy Winfrey (works as an animator for South Park), and they&amp;rsquo;re pretty cute. I started watching her current toon, Making Fiends, that revolves around two little girls, Vendetta and Charlotte, who go to school together. Vendetta makes all sorts of fiends and attempts to intimidate and destroy Charlotte, while Charlotte&amp;rsquo;s busy making friends. That led me to her previous set of toons, MuffinFilms, which are a variety of short animations involving muffins.</description>
