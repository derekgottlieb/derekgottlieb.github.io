      <description>Surprise! We&amp;rsquo;d been up to Vanderbilt for our last clinic visit before the planned c-section and had just finished our tour of L&amp;amp;D; and were walking to the car to head home when baby Adelaide must&amp;rsquo;ve decided she liked the place so much she wanted to stay. Amanda&amp;rsquo;s water broke and so we went right back in and now baby Addy&amp;rsquo;s here! She was born @ 13:01 on the 17th and weighed in at a healthy 6 lbs 11 oz at 19 1/w inches.</description>

      <title>Merry Christmas, Movie-House!</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year. Time to watch favorites like &amp;ldquo;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&amp;rdquo; (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron Howard) and &amp;ldquo;A Christmas Story&amp;rdquo; (they looked at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears!). Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me before I had a chance to notice. Fortunately I was able to get the little bit of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as bad as I had feared.</description>
