      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took a trip for work back in December to provide cluster training for some of the engineers at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gulfaero.com/&#34;&gt;Gulfstream&lt;/a&gt;.  Seems like we also did some very minor maintenance on the cluster we administer there.  Anyway, I brought the camera along and had a chance to take a few pics while wandering around the riverfront.  Only got around to pulling them off my camera today, so here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
