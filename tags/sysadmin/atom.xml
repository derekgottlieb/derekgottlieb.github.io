      <title>Synology DSM7 SPK for Nomad</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been interested in experimenting with Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Nomad for deploying/running apps as an alternative to the the somewhat convoluted combination of Docker + ansible I currently use. Since I primarily use a Synology NAS for running Dockerized apps, my first hurdle was coming up with a way to somewhat sanely install the nomad server/client on a Synology. I found nomad-spk that was promising, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with the latest major version of the Synology OS (aka DSM7).</description>

      <description>I recently received a question about SGI&amp;rsquo;s pandora after someone found my run-pandora.sh script in my hpc-admin-scripts repo. They were looking for a way to test a server with a fair bit of memory in a short amount of time. They&amp;rsquo;d tried Memtest86 and found it to be incredibly slow when running single-threaded or proved too unstable when running on all cores. When they found my repo, they figured it&amp;rsquo;d be worth asking about pandora in the hopes it would be appropriate for their needs.</description>

      <title>Ramblings About IT Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2015/10/10/ramblings-about-it-philosophy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking that I should write down some of my views on IT. I
don&amp;rsquo;t believe in a black &amp;amp; white world, but in one that&amp;rsquo;s full of realities,
tradeoffs, and compromises. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with people who refuse to (or are
unable to) recognize that and spend energy trying to dictate instead of
collaborate, typically to the detriment of themselves and frustration of
everyone around them. IT exists to support and enable an organization, and
should not be an end unto itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VPS provider hopping</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2015/01/24/vps-provider-hopping/</link>

      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2015/01/24/vps-provider-hopping/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a while back I started looking at alternative VPS hosting providers. I was
impressed by the service Linode provided, but started wondering if I&amp;rsquo;d get
better bang for my buck going elsewhere. At the time, I was paying $20 / month
for their smallest Xen VPS or $25 / month if I wanted their backup service. My
hosting needs were modest, especially since I&amp;rsquo;d migrated just about everything
from dynamic stuff with a DB backend to primarily serving static content. So I
could really get away with something with leaner. I shied away from the
extremely cheap OpenVZ providers, and tried a couple of different KVM VPS
providers before I found one that offered a balance of cost, reliability, and
performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Btrfs production experiences</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2013/04/29/btrfs-production-experiences/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2013/04/29/btrfs-production-experiences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My experience is based on SUSE SLES 11 SP1/SP2 with a stock kernel, so YMMV if
you&amp;rsquo;re running a newer mainline kernel without all the backports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested on two Supermicro systems. One with an LSI HBA card with 22x 2TB
enterprise SATA drives (originally purchased to run OpenSolaris/ZFS). Second
has an Adaptec hardware RAID controller with 36x 2TB enterprise SATA drives.
Some of the data loss and stability issues I experienced may be attributed to
later discovering the &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; drives used in the first system turned out
to be less RAID-friendly than the manufacturer claimed, eventually leading to
them to replace ALL of my drives with a different model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btrfs was a preview in SLES SP1 and is &amp;ldquo;supported&amp;rdquo; in SP2 but with major
restrictions if you wanted a supported configuration. Support in SP2 requires
that you create btrfs filesystems using Yast and live with the limited options
it allows.  I&amp;rsquo;m guessing what you can do via Yast is the subset of features
they tested enough to be willing to try and support.  I tried using Yast to set
up btrfs on one of our systems, but found their constraints too limiting given
my use case and the organization I&amp;rsquo;d settled on in the SP1 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Locking your Mac based on iPhone proximity</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2012/11/21/locking-your-mac-based-on-iphone-proximity/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2012/11/21/locking-your-mac-based-on-iphone-proximity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; I should note I only partially sorted out getting this to actually
work.  Probably requires more tinkering and may be best to just go get an app
that does the lock/unlock for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure is roughly based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://bazscott.com/blog/2012/10/09/lock-your-mac-when-your-iphone-is-out-of-range/&#34;&gt;Lock Your Mac When Your iPhone Is Out of
Range&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;d seen this in the past, but never got around to figuring out how to set it
up.  Since I&amp;rsquo;ve got an iPhone with good battery life, leaving Bluetooth on
isn&amp;rsquo;t as scary as it was on my old Android phone, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a
shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone the extra steps of figuring out how to retrieve your password from
Keychain in order to do the unlock.  The sample unlock AppleScript in that post
suggests storing your Mac account password in plain text in the script (not so
great) and offers that you can save your script as &amp;ldquo;Run-only&amp;rdquo; to obfuscate it.
I tried that for kicks and while the script itself is obfuscated, your plain
text password is still there if you just cat the file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yet another time of migration (blog-wise)&amp;hellip;
TextDrive -&amp;gt; Joyent -&amp;gt; TextDrive 2 My web hosting has been a little up in the air recently (see Slashdot: Joyent Drops Lifetime Account Holders).
I paid a few hundred bucks several years back (2005) for &amp;ldquo;lifetime&amp;rdquo; web hosting at what I perceived to be a cool up and coming company (read: they claimed to be pushing to support a lot of the flashy new web tech that wasn&amp;rsquo;t well supported by most shared web hosting providers at the time).</description>

      <title>The cost of supercomputing</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2010/11/12/the-cost-of-supercomputing/</link>

      <guid>https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2010/11/12/the-cost-of-supercomputing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this upcoming week is the big annual supercomputing convention,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://sc10.supercomputing.org&#34;&gt;SC10&lt;/a&gt;, down in New Orleans.  Since I&amp;rsquo;m
skipping out (anxiously waiting for the arrival of Little Miss Sunshine), I&amp;rsquo;ve
got time to actually try and read through the slew of new product announcements
and news coverage.  So today I saw this quote on twitter from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/hpc_guru&#34;&gt;hpc_guru&lt;/a&gt; and just had to share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cost of the building next generation of supercomputers is not the problem. The cost of running the machines is what concerns engineers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Bad Karma</title>

      <description>I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve been swimming in bad karma or something lately. First, I broke the nice set of Sennheiser HD515 cans I use at work leaving me with the craptacular closed Aiwas I&amp;rsquo;d used before seeing the light. Then, I broke the belt clip on my cellphone. Fortunately, superglue seems to have solved both problems.
Then, I realized my Thinkpad wasn&amp;rsquo;t charging like it should. Everything indicated it was charging, but the battery meter kept getting lower.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering from some bad computer mojo as of recent.
First our group fileserver tanked. Not that I really came into physical contact with it, but I talked to it over the network all the time. Then my brand spankin&amp;rsquo; new NAS drive (got a Buffalo LinkStation, basically an external hard drive enclosure with ethernet instead of USB/Firewire) had some sort of catastrophic firmware failure while I was using it and I was forced to RMA it.</description>

      <description>Fairly recently, the company that made our group fileserver was bought up by Sun. So we&amp;rsquo;re not really sure whether we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to renew our service contract (which runs out October 20th), or if we&amp;rsquo;ll be forced to buy a new Sun fileserver at a discount. The cynic in all of us should know what&amp;rsquo;s coming next&amp;hellip;
On Friday, our group fileserver sorta flaked. Took the admins an hour or more to get it back up and running, and when it did our current group mount (ie the one with all the stuff I really care about right now) did not come up with it.</description>

      <description>What a relief! Just got news the RAID card has come in, was installed, and with a fair bit of manual tinkering the admins managed to restore access to our unbacked-up mount. They&amp;rsquo;re in the process of migrating the data elsewhere and we should have a temporary workaround up and running in short order. Looks like we haven&amp;rsquo;t lost anything since some files have access times from last Friday. Will have to do some testing to see if anything was corrupted, but I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a whole lot better about it than I was earlier today.</description>

      <description>I know this was posted last week on slashdot, but it looks like the website for OpenSUSE finally went live. Pretty exciting stuff. First RedHat split their distro into a commercial, &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; class distro and the bleeding-edge, completely open distro Fedora (open in the sense that more than just RedHat employees were actively contributing to its development and direction). Now Novell has opened up SUSE. If I remember correctly, it used to be an exclusively commercial distro if I remember correctly&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t available for free download.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to hold off on buying a new PC for the foreseeable future. Have been wanting to put together a new gaming box with a semi-current graphics card so that I could play some games. My old Athlon box, polonius, is a bit long in the tooth, and my notebook, laertes, just doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite cut it on everything. My Dell box, horatio, is fairly current (P4/2.4GHz) from the clunky video (GeForce 4 MX), but until recently I enjoyed using it exclusively as an always-on Linux box.</description>

      <description>Got some more info on all of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s hub-bub. Apparently, one of the Lieberts (air conditioners) blew up in the server room yesterday, spraying cold water everywhere. The admins spent all day yesterday cleaning up the mess (disassembling the servers, cleaning them out, drying everying, testing them, etc). The main servers are all back up as of this morning, so email, home directories, and the firewall are all available again. The bad news is our group fileserver was directly in front of the Liebert when it blew up.</description>

      <description>I got an unexpected day off today. Things were all hunky dorey this morning, but then around 11 something happened. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely clear on what. Sounded like someone was doing some sort of maintenance work down in the basement, something went boom, and several fire sprinklers went off in the machine room. Needless to say, the admins quickly shut everything down and went about cleaning up the mess, drying out all the computers and trying to get everything shifted over to another room.</description>

      <description>So Elysium seems to be having more trouble these days. Some games are pretty choppy, just plain refuse to load, etc. Can&amp;rsquo;t quite decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s a hardware or software issue. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wiped so that&amp;rsquo;s a possibility. Also seems there might be some issues with the drivers MS included with XP for my network card. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the quirks associated with my memory (populating all 3 DIMM slots may not be a Good Thing), and my so-called RAID card (random reboots when the drives get heavily accessed).</description>
