      <description>Ran across this site recently, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could describe it any better than the site itself does:

Friends, meet Jon Arbuckle. Letâ€™s laugh and learn with him on a journey deep into the tortured mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness in a quiet American suburb.</description>
