                <p><p>Recently, someone from the <a href="http://www.phf.org/">Public Health Foundation</a>
contacted me because they found a blog post I had from back in 2005,
specifically <a href="/blog/2005/04/28/corporategovernment-parodies-on-the-web/">Corporate/Government Parodies on the
Web</a>. They asked if
I&rsquo;d like to update the broken reference to mypyramid.gov (which no longer
exists) in favor of a new government nutrition website. Having gone back and
re-read the post for context, I initially thought I&rsquo;d just ignore it for the
moment since I figured it had to be some automated webcrawler of sending emails
to DNS contacts for any hits referencing the old .gov URL. But they actually
sent me a followup email, so I thought I might go ahead and make some updates.</p></p>

                <p>My masters have hauled me down to this strange new land they keep referring to as The South. It seems like I&rsquo;ve been hear for ages, which is apparently just long enough for them to inflict me with a bladder infection. I felt so uncomfortable I showed them who&rsquo;s boss by peeing in things to anger them, and figured they&rsquo;d break them any moment. Since they hadn&rsquo;t made me better, I figured I had to be more blunt with these simpletons and started going to the litter box every fifteen minutes and I even stooped so low as to drag my ass on the carpet like a filthy dog.</p>

                <p>Ran across this site recently, and I&rsquo;m not sure I could describe it any better than the site itself does:
Who would have guessed that when you remove Garfield from the Garfield comic strips, the result is an even better comic about schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the empty desperation of modern life? Friends, meet Jon Arbuckle. Let’s laugh and learn with him on a journey deep into the tortured mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness in a quiet American suburb.</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year. Time to watch favorites like &ldquo;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&rdquo; (the real one, not that live-action debacle starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron Howard) and &ldquo;A Christmas Story&rdquo; (they looked at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears!). Seems like Christmas has rushed up to me before I had a chance to notice. Fortunately I was able to get the little bit of shopping I wanted to do done yesterday, and no it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as I had feared.</p>

                <p>They give me a little taste, and then take it away. I can&rsquo;t take this kind of abuse. I just need my tasty kibbles. Aaah! Can&rsquo;t they hear me begging for one more hit?
Tried to work out some of my energy leaping at the fun string that makes the light come on. Can you believe they left the lid to the washer open? They&rsquo;re out to get me. I just can&rsquo;t stand the pressure.</p>

                <p>Day 752 of my captivity. Found what I hope is one of my captor&rsquo;s favorite possessions. It appears to be some sort of container for transporting instruments of my exploitation and I believe it to be associated with their obnoxious light flashing device.
I have thoroughly inspected it&rsquo;s contents to ascertain if it might hold anything I could use in my escape. Having found nothing, I destroyed it&rsquo;s lining with my claws and ate the outer edges to prevent its further use.</p>
