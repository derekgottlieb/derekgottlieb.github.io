                <p>Day 746 of my captivity. My captors continued to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal.
The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from clawing the furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant.
Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded.</p>

                <p>manscaping: to groom a man. Shaving, waxing, cleaning up the superfluous fur.
Courtest of the Urban Dictionary. A collaborative (think wikipedia) dictionary for modern slang. Found out about this earlier this week on the Rep yahoo group. Since a lot of slang is a bit crude in nature, I don&rsquo;t have to warn you that this site may offend some of the prudish folk out there. You&rsquo;ve been warned&hellip; I could probably spend all day looking through that site.</p>

                <p>A physically attractive female who looks as if she may belong to a sorority, while at the same time being dressed like a complete slut. A true sorostitute would wear a low-cut halter top and a short, tight skirt in the middle of wintertime.

                <p>I got some more of the disposable cameras from the wedding processed. Nothing too interesting aside from a few shots of the cats I took to use up film that I&rsquo;ve put up in the usual place. Here are a couple of highlights:

Merry likes to play in the laundry
Spooky likes to play in the big soup pot Silly kitties! And now that my folks have come to visit the grand-kitties (don&rsquo;t ask&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t coin the phrase), they have all sorts of new cat toys to play with.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few of these around town. Apparently the park district is spinning them as restoring some of the land controlled by the park district to it&rsquo;s original &ldquo;prairie&rdquo; condition. In practice, I think this largely translates to &ldquo;um, this is too much work, so we&rsquo;re just going to stop mowing some of these and put up a sign.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve always found the park district to be rather interesting around here.</p>

                <p>Saw this Slashdot post. A student at CMU made a website parodying the Wal-Mart Foundation (a thinly veiled attempt to improve the parent corp&rsquo;s public image through small scattered donations) for a class on &ldquo;Parasitic Media&rdquo;. Guess Wal-Mart didn&rsquo;t take too kindly to how they were portrayed, so they whipped out that horrendous piece of legeslation, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA&rsquo;s a vague wording allows large corporations with lots of cash to easily threaten things they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
