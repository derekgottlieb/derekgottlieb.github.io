      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking that I should write down some of my views on IT. I
don&amp;rsquo;t believe in a black &amp;amp; white world, but in one that&amp;rsquo;s full of realities,
tradeoffs, and compromises. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with people who refuse to (or are
unable to) recognize that and spend energy trying to dictate instead of
collaborate, typically to the detriment of themselves and frustration of
everyone around them. IT exists to support and enable an organization, and
should not be an end unto itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
