&lt;p&gt;Surprise!  We&amp;rsquo;d been up to Vanderbilt for our last clinic visit before the planned c-section and had just finished our tour of L&amp;D; and were walking to the car to head home when baby Adelaide must&amp;rsquo;ve decided she liked the place so much she wanted to stay.  Amanda&amp;rsquo;s water broke and so we went right back in and now baby Addy&amp;rsquo;s here!  She was born @ 13:01 on the 17th and weighed in at a healthy 6 lbs 11 oz at 19 1/w inches.  Not bad for 4 weeks early!&lt;/p&gt;
