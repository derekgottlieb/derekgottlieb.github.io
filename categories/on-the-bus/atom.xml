      <description>I saw an interesting bicycle while riding the bus today. It was one of those bicycles built for two. While those are unusual, I have never seen one quite like this. The front half of the bike was clearly designed for an adult rider, but the back half appeared to be intended for someone much shorter. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the back half is intended for a child or just someone of shorter than usual stature since it only had a full-sized rider up front when I saw it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add a new category to my blog&amp;hellip; I call it &amp;ldquo;On the bus.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a collection of experiences that I&amp;rsquo;ve had riding the bus to campus. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few experiences in the past week that seemed to warrant mention here, so I thought it seemed appropriate to add a new category for this type of rambling.</description>
