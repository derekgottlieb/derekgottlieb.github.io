      <description>In ethology, zugunruhe is anxious behavior in migratory animals that are prevented from migrating, especially in birds. When these animals are enclosed, they exhibit this behaviour during the seasons in which they normally migrate. Behaviourists have been able to study the endocrine controls and navigational mechanisms associated with migration from studying zugunruhe.
This term is German in origin and is a compound of Zug (move, migration) and Unruhe (anxiety, restlessness).</description>

      <description>McGuffin (aka: MacGuffin or maguffin) is a term for a plot enabling device, i.e. a device or plot element in a movie that is deliberately placed to catch the viewer&amp;rsquo;s attention and/or drive the logic of the plot, but which actually serves no further purpose - it won&amp;rsquo;t pop up again later, it won&amp;rsquo;t explain the ending, it won&amp;rsquo;t actually do anything except possibly distract you while you try to figure out its significance.</description>

      <description>From the novel &amp;ldquo;Stranger in a Strange Land&amp;rdquo;, by Robert A. Heinlein, where it is a Martian word meaning literally &amp;ldquo;to drink&amp;rdquo; and metaphorically &amp;ldquo;to be one with&amp;rdquo;. [Source]
  To understand, usually in a global sense. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. Contrast zen, which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash. See also glark.
  Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding. &amp;ldquo;Almost all C compilers grok the &amp;ldquo;void&amp;rdquo; type these days.</description>

      <description>According to BJ, a glibbet is a small, weasel-like animal. Unfortunately, I have been unable to confirm this is a legit word. Most of the references I have found on the web state that it&amp;rsquo;s a nonsense, made-up word. BJ&amp;rsquo;s convinced it&amp;rsquo;s legit, but I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s just a word his favorite author made up for one of his books. I could be wrong though. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask Amanda&amp;rsquo;s mom and see if she actually confirmed this word somewhere, or if BJ just showed it to her in one of his books.</description>

      <description>A frequent, chronological publication of personal thoughts and Web links. [Source]
Background:
A blog is often a mixture of what is happening in a person&amp;rsquo;s life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people.
People maintained blogs long before the term was coined, but the trend gained momentum with the introduction of automated published systems, most notably Blogger at blogger.</description>
