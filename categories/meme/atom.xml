      <description>There is a test for Buffy (probably more than one, but this is the first one I found).
You are Xander
&amp;ldquo;Cavalry&amp;rsquo;s here! Cavalry&amp;rsquo;s a frightened guy with a rock, but it&amp;rsquo;s here!&amp;rdquo; What &amp;ldquo;Buffy&amp;rdquo; Character Are You?</description>

      <description>Hmm. In the same spirit as the tests at Fuali.com, I ran across this one for the show Sliders. Man that was a good show. Wish I had Sci-Fi so I could watch it. Been looking around the net some, and it sounds like they&amp;rsquo;re slated to release the first season on DVD in April&amp;hellip; That would be pretty cool. Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that show in ages. Oh yeah, my test results for Sliders:</description>

      <description>Took some tests at Fuali.com. Here are my results:
I am 29% Geek
You probably work in computers, or a history deptartment at a college. You never really fit in with the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; crowd. But you have friends, and this is a good thing.
I am 37% Internet Addict
I could go either way. Deep into the madness of nights filled with coding CGI-Scripts and online role playing games, or I could become a normal user.</description>
