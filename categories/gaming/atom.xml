      <description>Yeah, so Meijer had this great sale going on today. You could buy a GC for $99. And if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough, you got 10% off anything you purchased. So you end up actually getting a GC for $89. Hard to pass up, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t. Got a couple of games (Animal Crossing and Mario Party 4) along with a 2nd controller so at least Amanda and I can play togeter.</description>
