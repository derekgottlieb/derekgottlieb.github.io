                <p>Looks like the DI did actually send a photographer to the Evanescence concert&hellip; they just never bothered to publish a story or any photos about it until now. Basically, they&rsquo;ve got a feature on the DI Finest Photos of 2004 (little presumptuous seeing as the year&rsquo;s not even half over). But apparently, they thought this photo of Evanescence was one of their best of the year. Why it wouldn&rsquo;t have warranted publishing earlier on that basis, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

                <p>So Richy had some nice news for me. Turns out somebody managed to get a high quality bootleg of Monday&rsquo;s concert up by Tuesday afternoon. Quality&rsquo;s quite good, so you may want to check it out. Also, Richy&rsquo;s got his pictures up from the concert now. You can see them here.</p>

                <p>So Amanda and I (along with Richy, Carrie, Lee, and Dan) went to the Ben Folds concert last night at Foellinger. The show was great! The opening act was a great string trio led by David Berkeley on guitar, and assisted by Will Robertson on upright bass and Adam Buchwald(?) on mandolin. They were really good. I loved the mix of the 3 instruments. You should definitely check out David Berkeley if you get the chance (there&rsquo;s a mp3 available for download on his page of a song &ldquo;Fire Sign&rdquo; that was featured in CBS' show Without a Trace).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/02/26/evanescence/'><h1>Evanescence</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I saw Evanescence in concert this past Tuesday at the Assembly Hall. Great show.
First opening act, Atomship, was kinda eh. They weren&rsquo;t awful, but they certainly weren&rsquo;t very good either. Lead singer was pretty weird. Had something vaguely resembling a British accent until he mentioned they were from Mississippi when he suddenly reverted to a good ol' boy accent. And he had this weird twitchy, seizurey sort of &ldquo;dance&rdquo; thing.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2003/12/02/liz_phair_followup/'><h1>Liz Phair followup</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Just wanted to post a quick followup to my previous Liz Phair post. Found this pretty cool shot of her performing at Foellinger (courtesy of the Daily Illini).
I lost count, but I believe she rotated between 3 Fender electrics and some sort of acoustic during the course of the show with her roadie retuning between swaps. She claimed she had to swap out guitars a lot because he would have to retune depending on the song.</p>

                <p>Yeah, so things have been pretty busy the past several months, and I haven&rsquo;t made any posts here since the fall semester started. Anyway, just wanted to pop on here to say I went to the Liz Phair concert last night and it rocked. Quite outstanding. If you haven&rsquo;t heard her stuff, and like &ldquo;chick rock&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d suggest checking her out. Her most recent album is more pop than her older stuff.</p>
