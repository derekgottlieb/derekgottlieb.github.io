                <p>Star Wars: Episode III is out! And it&rsquo;s supposed to be good. Very dark, but good. I&rsquo;ve heard it actually does a good job wrapping things up and bridging the new with the old. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to see it before too long (headed out of town to go to Amanda&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s wedding tomorrow and my folks will be here next week). Of course, I&rsquo;ve heard a fairly high quality work print has been leaked.</p>

                <p>As I suspected, the 10.4.1 update for Tiger has been released. Looks like they&rsquo;ve fixed quite a number of things (seems to have possibly solved some of the crashes/lockups I&rsquo;d experienced so far&hellip; at least, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve had one since I updated).</p>

                <p>So it would seem that the release of iTunes by Apple largely killed off the other music playing apps (ie mp3 players). Which is lame because I find the interface a little bulky, doesn&rsquo;t seem like I can have it sort based on directory structure, and I find it a little annoying that by default it wants to copy all of your music to a &ldquo;My Music&rdquo; type folder when you import new stuff.</p>

                <p>Ok, it&rsquo;s not exactly news. But I&rsquo;ve randomly run into some more food oddities. I say randomly because I ran across it on this guy&rsquo;s del.icio.us bookmarks (he wrote Cocoalicious, a slick del.icio.us client for OS X). Anyway, here&rsquo;s the link. Featured are the Luther Burger (a bacon cheeseburger served on a toasted Krispy Kreme bun) and the Hamdog (a hot dog wrapped in a beef patty that&rsquo;s deep fried, covered with chili, cheese and onions, and served on a hoagie bun topped with a fried egg and two fistfuls of fries).</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few of these around town. Apparently the park district is spinning them as restoring some of the land controlled by the park district to it&rsquo;s original &ldquo;prairie&rdquo; condition. In practice, I think this largely translates to &ldquo;um, this is too much work, so we&rsquo;re just going to stop mowing some of these and put up a sign.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve always found the park district to be rather interesting around here.</p>

                <p>Amanda was telling me that the mayor of Detroit (who&rsquo;s apparently assisted in creating a 300 million dollar deficit) has proposed an additional tax on fast-food to help fill the city&rsquo;s coffers. Guess this is a strategic move since Detroit&rsquo;s ranked third on the list of &ldquo;fattest cities&rdquo; (following Houston and Chicago)&hellip;
On a related note, I saw this other article at CNN about a restaurant that&rsquo;s started selling a 15-pound burger!</p>

                <p>Looks like Tiger&rsquo;s new Dashboard could use some refinement when it comes to security. Looks like it&rsquo;s pretty trivial to make a user auto-download a widget when they visit a webpage in Safari, it&rsquo;ll then auto-install if they&rsquo;re using the default Safari settings, and then they&rsquo;ll be running a potentially very obnoxious (and possibly even malicious) widget that&rsquo;s impossible for average Joe user to remove. With any luck they&rsquo;ll refine this a bit in 10.</p>

                <p>Looks like Apples&rsquo;s released Java 1.5 for Tiger. Not quite sure why people aren&rsquo;t talking about this (was released same day as Tiger&rsquo;s &ldquo;official&rdquo; release date) since a lot of people had mentioned it being present in the Tiger developer test releases and that it was absent from the final version released to the public. Looks like I can finally see about getting Liberty&rsquo;s LSE up and running on OS X.</p>
