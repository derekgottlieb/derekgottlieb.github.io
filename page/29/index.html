                <p>So I&rsquo;ve spent a good portion of the weekend working on getting wedding invites/response cards printed up on my old laser. Not to toot my own horn, but I think they turned out pretty cool. The font Amanda used (A Yummy Apology) went really well with her watercolor flowers and the deckled edges on the paper (scares me that I know what that means). Anyway, they&rsquo;re pretty cool and should be spooling up to send them all out before much longer.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/04/15/movie_db/'><h1>Movie DB</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So my movie database continues to evolve. I guess first I should mention what it does at this point. Basically, I feed movie title in, my script searches for it in the IMDB, presents the possible matches, and then fills in all the info from IMDB (title, year, genres, director, stars, etc). Then I can easily edit it as needed. Tonight I added some basic caching of the main page. In other words, if you aren&rsquo;t doing any sort of special query (ie list everything), it will dump the webpage to a file and simply display that if it&rsquo;s current, and only recreate it when the database has been updated.</p>

                <p>So Richy had some nice news for me. Turns out somebody managed to get a high quality bootleg of Monday&rsquo;s concert up by Tuesday afternoon. Quality&rsquo;s quite good, so you may want to check it out. Also, Richy&rsquo;s got his pictures up from the concert now. You can see them here.</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve been going nuts working on class projects this semester. I&rsquo;m trying to wrap up the last of my class work and am currently taking a couple of ECE497 courses (special topics grad courses where professors largely discuss their own research interests).
Nick&rsquo;s teaching one on Unconventional Computer Architecture that&rsquo;s been pretty interesting so far. Project&rsquo;s coming along pretty well for that and most of my responsibilities have been finished.</p>

                <p>So Amanda and I (along with Richy, Carrie, Lee, and Dan) went to the Ben Folds concert last night at Foellinger. The show was great! The opening act was a great string trio led by David Berkeley on guitar, and assisted by Will Robertson on upright bass and Adam Buchwald(?) on mandolin. They were really good. I loved the mix of the 3 instruments. You should definitely check out David Berkeley if you get the chance (there&rsquo;s a mp3 available for download on his page of a song &ldquo;Fire Sign&rdquo; that was featured in CBS' show Without a Trace).</p>

                <p>McGuffin (aka: MacGuffin or maguffin) is a term for a plot enabling device, i.e. a device or plot element in a movie that is deliberately placed to catch the viewer&rsquo;s attention and/or drive the logic of the plot, but which actually serves no further purpose - it won&rsquo;t pop up again later, it won&rsquo;t explain the ending, it won&rsquo;t actually do anything except possibly distract you while you try to figure out its significance.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/03/24/cubic_cyclonium/'><h1>Cubic Cyclonium</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So early last week, I received the coolest thing from a guy at Altera. It&rsquo;s called the Cubic Cyclonium, and it makes one heck of a paperweight. In essence, it&rsquo;s a small system designed around an Altera Cyclone FPGA and includes a bunch of cool stuff (168 LED array, 1MB of SRAM, VGA out), all embedded in a block of clear Lexan plastic. It draws power over a USB cable, includes software to program it to do a variety of neat demos (defaults to displaying time and date, can display a scrolling marquee text message, stock quotes, and several games/screensavers including tetris, pong, life, etc).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/03/23/machine_names/'><h1>Machine Names</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve explicitly mentioned it, but I ended up renaming most of my machines a while back. I decided to switch to a theme as opposed to the random naming scheme I was using before (ie Malaise, Elysium, Nicosia, Sulaco, Aragorn, etc). At this point, most of my stuff is named after characters in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet. My aging Athlon box (Elysium) has been named after Polonius, the doddering old fool.</p>

                <p>Well, I finally did it. I signed myself for an actual, bonafide web hosting service. No more being limited to what will fit on my University server (and having to move that every so often) or running off my Linux box over really slow uplink. I&rsquo;m still in the process of moving in (which will involve a rework of my website to some extent), but have managed to relocate my blog and start transferring some of the pictures in my gallery.</p>
