                <p>Saw the scariest thing on my drive into work today. Was at a stoplight behind a giant yellow schoolbus&hellip; with a big &ldquo;STUDENT DRIVER&rdquo; sign on the back. Eek! Watching them try to make a turn didn&rsquo;t make me ever want to put my kid on a schoolbus. Ever.</p>

                <p>Amanda and I have been pretty busy since we closed on the house. We&rsquo;ve looked at flooring some, and I&rsquo;ve started the ball rolling on fixing the windows (several of the double panes had broken seals). We&rsquo;ve also done a fair bit of painting, sanding, staining, sealing, spackling, de-wallpapering, cleaning, landscaping&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep a pretty good photo log of our progress over in the gallery. Basically, I&rsquo;ve got a full tour of the house as it was at closing, and then a separate album tracking our progress in each room.</p>

                <p>So slashdot had an interesting IT review link today: Juvenile felis catus (or &ldquo;kitten&rdquo; for you laymen). Full of very cute pictures, a lot of tongue-in-cheek commentary, and links to all sorts of amusing/geeky/just plain weird sites (standard kitten package and CAT Users&rsquo; Manual). Oh, and he even provides a convenient summary comparison against competing models (i.e. puppies, babies, or a new video card). Now that Amanda and I have a house, we&rsquo;ll get to start looking for kittens before long.</p>

                <p>So, Amanda and I closed on the new house yesterday morning. We&rsquo;re already starting to feel like homeowners. And by that, I mean we&rsquo;ve already started tearing the place apart. :) For those that are interested, I&rsquo;ve got some pictures up over in the gallery (taken with the new Digital Rebel).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/09/25/new-header-image/'><h1>New Header Image</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So, I&rsquo;ve finally gotten around to working on a custom header image for my blog. Not sure that I&rsquo;m quite happy with it yet, but I like the feel of it better than the default that came with Kubrick. One of the flowers Amanda painted for our wedding invitations was the inspiration&hellip; but I think it may be a bit too girly. Will have to see what I think after a bit more time.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/09/22/firefox-switchproxy/'><h1>Firefox: SwitchProxy</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Ran across SwitchProxy for Firefox. Looks pretty cool. Basically you can set it up to download a list of open anonymous proxy servers, and hop between them at a specified interval (ie every minute it looks like you&rsquo;re surfing from a different IP). Good deal for anyone who&rsquo;s a little concerned about anonymity.</p>

                <p>So as of a few weeks ago, they finally got the parking deck close enough to &ldquo;finished&rdquo; to open it. By &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, I mean the bulk of the structure is there, but they&rsquo;re still actively working on it. Like putting in the sidewalks around it, putting in the street to the south, actually building up the 1st floor interior (where all the &ldquo;retail&rdquo; is supposed to go). Oh, and of course installing the elevators.</p>

                <p>Yay! My Digital Rebel just got here!!
To recap, I finally decided to break down and get myself something fun for getting my thesis deposited. Decided last week that I&rsquo;d get myself a Canon Digital Rebel EOS-300D if I could find it at a price I liked. Ended up getting it at a pretty decent price ($200-250 off what I could get it for locally). Looks like it should be a pretty sweet camera ([Review, Another).</p>

                <p>Got two rants today. First off, what is up with FedEx? I bought something online that was shipped via 3-day FedEx. Estimated delivery is for tomorrow (to hit the 3-day deadline). Well, turns out they had it sitting in their local office this morning before they pack up the trucks for the day&rsquo;s deliveries. But since I had only paid for 3-day, they decided to leave it sitting on the dock to be delivered tomorrow so that I&rsquo;d know what I was missing out on by not going with 2-day.</p>
