                <p>So this story has been all over the place (at least if you read computing/HPC news). Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer and designer of the historically significant Apple I and Apple II, took a job as chief scientist at a startup I was already aware of, Fusion-io. They&rsquo;ve been designing PCIe boards loaded with flash memory to deliver super high performance storage to servers and maybe high-end gamers. In theory it&rsquo;s using similar technology to SSDs, but they&rsquo;re able to achieve significantly higher bandwidth and IOPs than has been achieved in an SSD that is focused on stuffing flash into a conventional SATA hard drive form factor.</p>

                <p>A couple of weeks ago, we went up to Nashville and hit a number of the sights. I&rsquo;ll go ahead and split this into two posts, since I&rsquo;ve only uploaded some of the relevant photos so far. The first day, we hit their recreation of the Parthenon. Apparently, it&rsquo;s actually the second replica they&rsquo;ve built, with the first being built in 1897 to celebrate their centennial but it was only built to last 6 months.</p>

                <p>My masters have hauled me down to this strange new land they keep referring to as The South. It seems like I&rsquo;ve been hear for ages, which is apparently just long enough for them to inflict me with a bladder infection. I felt so uncomfortable I showed them who&rsquo;s boss by peeing in things to anger them, and figured they&rsquo;d break them any moment. Since they hadn&rsquo;t made me better, I figured I had to be more blunt with these simpletons and started going to the litter box every fifteen minutes and I even stooped so low as to drag my ass on the carpet like a filthy dog.</p>

                <p>Medical researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) have discovered a new use for scorpion venom &ndash; cancer medication. Each year, some 9,000 Americans are diagnosed with malignant glioma, a form of brain cancer that kills about half its victims within a year of diagnosis.
Glioma cells work a lot like cockroach muscle cells. And while that fact is pretty disgusting, it also got UAB researchers thinking about the giant Israeli scorpion, whose venom is harmless to humans but deadly to its cockroach prey.</p>

                <p>On the drive back from Savannah, Charles and I quickly stopped in to visit the Robins Air Force Base Museum of Aviation. Didn&rsquo;t spend very long there, but it wasn&rsquo;t too much out of the way for the drive back and had a chance to take a few pics. There were some more unusual planes there that I&rsquo;d meant to go back and look up info on, but obviously hadn&rsquo;t since I only just pulled the photos off my camera a few days ago with the rest of the photos from Savannah.</p>

                <p>Finally caught up with going through my photos and uploading to Flickr. Katie was in town visiting this past week (Spring Break). Aside from the holy week activities (choir tired now), one afternoon Amanda and I took off work and all three of us went to the Space &amp; Rocket Center. Lots of interesting historical NASA stuff (early V-2 rockets, Saturn V/Apollo stuff, etc), but I have to admit some of it felt a bit slapped together.</p>

                <p>Took a trip for work back in December to provide cluster training for some of the engineers at Gulfstream. Seems like we also did some very minor maintenance on the cluster we administer there. Anyway, I brought the camera along and had a chance to take a few pics while wandering around the riverfront. Only got around to pulling them off my camera today, so here they are:</p>

                <p>Ran across this site recently, and I&rsquo;m not sure I could describe it any better than the site itself does:
 Who would have guessed that when you remove Garfield from the Garfield comic strips, the result is an even better comic about schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the empty desperation of modern life? Friends, meet Jon Arbuckle. Let’s laugh and learn with him on a journey deep into the tortured mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness in a quiet American suburb.</p>

                <p>An occasion like Hallowe&rsquo;en, April Fool&rsquo;s, or Father&rsquo;s/Mother&rsquo;s Day. Though not categorized as an official holiday, is often used as a good occasion to get a good drunk on with friends.
&ldquo;Shit dude! It&rsquo;s Hallowe&rsquo;en, my favorite alcoholiday! Let&rsquo;s get done up as Zombies and get druuuuunk!!!&rdquo;
