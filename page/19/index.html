                <p>I&rsquo;ve switched IM clients already. Fire just wasn&rsquo;t as featureful/configurable as I would like, so I&rsquo;ve started using Adium X. Got Firefox for the pages that don&rsquo;t work right in Safari. Fink of course for additional Unix goodies (mostly extra compilation stuff). SSHKeychain provides a convenient interface to ssh-agent and simplifies key management. DoubleCommand lets me remap some keys (ie I can make my Ctrl key act like an Apple Command key), and the next version should differentiate between left and right keys allowing me to have both a Ctrl and a Command key (since Ctrl is sorta essential for emacs).</p>

                <p>So the pages feature looks like it&rsquo;ll be pretty slick. I&rsquo;ve managed to set up the main frontpage for the site so that it loads up the page I created inside of WP. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s the most efficient way to do it, but it does work. Definitely looks like WP is well on it&rsquo;s way to being a fairly complete CMS (content management system). Will have to see if I can differentiate between blog pages and normal content pages so that I can have a reduced sidebar for all things not blog.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/02/18/wordpress-upgrade/'><h1>WordPress upgrade</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>As you may notice, I&rsquo;m in the middle of upgrading my WordPress install for the blog. I thought I&rsquo;d gotten the key stuff translated over to the new setup, so I switched over to the new stuff. While my blog looks mostly right (sans access buttons in the header), I&rsquo;d forgotten that a lot of the rest of my site was using chunks of old blog code for their appearance. Hence, when I swapped them out, the rest of the stuff tanked.</p>

                <p>Slowly making progress on the transition to 1.5. You&rsquo;ll note I sorta have the links back up in the header, but they aren&rsquo;t formatted like the rest of the site quite yet&hellip; And I still need to integrate the rest of the site with the new theme code instead of having to keep around the old blog code.
I&rsquo;ve made a mock-up of the malkier frontpage that you can see here.</p>

                <p>Our kitties are silly! Apparently, one of our fuzzy blankets reminds Spooky an awful lot of his mama, because he&rsquo;s taken to kneading, suckling, and lapping on it. I was petting him this morning (in an attempt to keep him from completely waking me up) when he started in on the blanket. He had to be going at that thing for at least half an hour. Silly kitty.
Even worse&hellip; Miss Merry was getting a little old when we adopted her, but I thought vaccinations should be top priority.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve had the mini for a couple of days now, and so far I have to say I&rsquo;m impressed. Cute little box and so far I&rsquo;ve largely been impressed with the speed and &ldquo;fluidity&rdquo; of it. OS X seems awful slick so far, barring the inevitable learning curve. In fairly short order I&rsquo;d found the Terminal and was greeted with a familiar bash prompt and even things like emacs (text-only) and ssh out of the box.</p>

                <p>Looks like my Mac mini is finally on its way! Granted, it looks like it&rsquo;s just been picked up in China today (Shenzhen?), so it&rsquo;ll likely be a while. But still very cool!</p>

                <p>Turns out Anandtech has started providing some Mac coverage. Anand starts off with A Month with a Mac: A Die-Hard PC User&rsquo;s Perspective providing his take on the Mac experience to the &ldquo;uninitiated&rdquo; with a hefty Dual-G5 desktop. This led to the mobile experience with a Powerbook. Most recently, he&rsquo;s taken a look at the Mac mini.</p>

                <p>Went to the Castle Theater in Bloomington yesterday with Amanda to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Really outstanding theater setup. Instead of the usual uncomfortable, cramped stadium seating, the Castle has a set of squishy couches and loveseats. Much more enjoyable experience. Raiders is such a classic.</p>

                <p>Macworld has lots of good coverage on the Mac mini. They&rsquo;ve got a nice review with benchmark results, discussion of some of the available options, and even some cool findings (looks like some of the 40GB machines come with 5400rpm drives instead of 4200, and some systems may come with faster RAM, but I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s actually being clocked any higher than PC2700). They&rsquo;ve got coverage on disassembly with lots of pictures (opening it up and stripping it down to bare components).</p>
