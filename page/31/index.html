                <p>There is a test for Buffy (probably more than one, but this is the first one I found).
You are Xander
&ldquo;Cavalry&rsquo;s here! Cavalry&rsquo;s a frightened guy with a rock, but it&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; What &ldquo;Buffy&rdquo; Character Are You?</p>

                <p>Hmm. In the same spirit as the tests at Fuali.com, I ran across this one for the show Sliders. Man that was a good show. Wish I had Sci-Fi so I could watch it. Been looking around the net some, and it sounds like they&rsquo;re slated to release the first season on DVD in April&hellip; That would be pretty cool. Haven&rsquo;t seen that show in ages. Oh yeah, my test results for Sliders:</p>

                <p>From the novel &ldquo;Stranger in a Strange Land&rdquo;, by Robert A. Heinlein, where it is a Martian word meaning literally &ldquo;to drink&rdquo; and metaphorically &ldquo;to be one with&rdquo;. [Source]
  To understand, usually in a global sense. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. Contrast zen, which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash. See also glark.
  Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding. &ldquo;Almost all C compilers grok the &ldquo;void&rdquo; type these days.</p>

                <p>Took some tests at Fuali.com. Here are my results:
I am 29% Geek

You probably work in computers, or a history deptartment at a college. You never really fit in with the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; crowd. But you have friends, and this is a good thing.
I am 37% Internet Addict

I could go either way. Deep into the madness of nights filled with coding CGI-Scripts and online role playing games, or I could become a normal user.</p>

                <p>Had an entertaining conversation with Jeff yesterday. Somehow we got on the topic of ECE291 and his team project. And how most of the rest of his team was pretty worthless. Anyway, he googled himself and showed me the webpage that the team made for their project. Turns out Gel (from IMSA) was on his team. So we started talking about her. So I guess Jeff was getting a little peeved by his team members and wasn&rsquo;t convinced they were putting any effort into the project.</p>

                <p>I think I&rsquo;ve figured out what&rsquo;s been troubling Elysium as of recent. After trying all sorts of stuff (updating my drivers, reinstalling the system from scratch several times, swapping out RAM, switching all partitions in the system over to NTFS&hellip;), I finally noticed that the fan on the video card is dead. That would likely account for some of my problems (ie chunky video whenever I stress the video card by going to full screen or doing any 3d).</p>

                <p>After a little bit of work, I got the simulation of 32 input vectors in parallel up and running in my simulator. Pretty sweet. Shouldn&rsquo;t be too bad to get basic sequential circuit support added in and then I&rsquo;ll have done both extra credit options. Mainly need to figure out how to time my program and the rest is trivial. Will probably look into doing some further optimizing of my code, but seems pretty zippy for any circuit I&rsquo;ve run it on so far.</p>

                <p>So, yesterday was Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I think I managed to succeed at being all sweet and romantical by surprising Amanda by making her lasagna from scratch with a side of garlic bread. Turned out pretty well considering I wasn&rsquo;t really following any particular recipe. Also got her a copy of &ldquo;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&rdquo; and a set of cute dragonfly chopsticks from ArtMart. Oh, and of course a cute little card with a whole bunch of lady bugs that form a heart.</p>
