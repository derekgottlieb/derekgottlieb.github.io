                <p>So I dug around for a bit, and ran across some pretty thorough coverage of the games at E3 over at GameSpot. All sorts of good stuff coming up. In the FPS category, you&rsquo;ve got Doom 3, Half-Life 2, Halo 2 that all look pretty good. There&rsquo;s the next Grand Theft Auto (San Andreas). The next Gran Turismo looks absolutely amazing. And they&rsquo;ve got a little info on the upcoming Zelda game.</p>

                <p>So Nintendo&rsquo;s released some screenshots and a trailer for an upcoming Zelda game. Looks freakin' awesome. I&rsquo;m totally looking forward to this one!</p>

                <p>Looks like the DI did actually send a photographer to the Evanescence concert&hellip; they just never bothered to publish a story or any photos about it until now. Basically, they&rsquo;ve got a feature on the DI Finest Photos of 2004 (little presumptuous seeing as the year&rsquo;s not even half over). But apparently, they thought this photo of Evanescence was one of their best of the year. Why it wouldn&rsquo;t have warranted publishing earlier on that basis, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

                <p>Well, it looks like Intel is finally going CMP (@ The Register and Reuters). They&rsquo;re apparently going to address some of the issues associated with continuing to push for high performance with big monolithic superscalars (namely: power consumption associated with crazy-high clock frequencies, scaling limitations of centralized hardware structures, and the benefits of supporting higher throughput through parallelism instead of only relying on low-latency for sequential code). Pretty exciting if you&rsquo;re a geek like me&hellip; and would love a multiprocessor system.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/05/07/getting_close/'><h1>Getting close...</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I&rsquo;m finally getting close to wrapping up this semester, which marks the end of my required course credits. All of the stuff for Nick&rsquo;s class finished up yesterday afternoon. The slides for all of the project presentations are up at the ECE497NC website. We managed to slap together something for the poster session for Matt&rsquo;s class this afternoon. Went ok, but since a large portion of the project is compiler stuff, and I haven&rsquo;t the remotest clue about compilers in general so&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t much help in fielding questions.</p>

                <p>Just ran across an interesting site. Appears to be a collection of oddball videos and such that have surfaced on the net. For example, there&rsquo;s this vid of a kid going after a pi?ata, and news footage of a helicopter crash (always figured they wouldn&rsquo;t be pretty with those giant spinning blades). Note: definitely not work safe stuff here (there&rsquo;s some non kid-friendly stuff there&hellip;).</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve finally decided the previous color scheme for Malkier was a little too bleak. And I&rsquo;ve been doing the whole black background thing for a bit too long (started way back in undergrad when everyone had plain grey backgrounds or awful background images and almost no one went black). Hopefully the new scheme is a little more festive&hellip; although I&rsquo;m not quite happy with it yet. And I finally got around to installing my own copy of my blog software (the old stuff was provided by the host and didn&rsquo;t allow me to customize the comments pages, or really control the blog as much as I would&rsquo;ve liked).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/04/21/sysadminco/'><h1>SysadminCo</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So every so often I&rsquo;ll read through some of the stuff at SysadminCo. It&rsquo;s a collection of stupid user questions and such send to the sysadmins at some ISP. They have some entertaining stuff sometimes, and have an amusing shell-like interface. Anyway, as I was skimming a bit today, I ran across this one techism that I got a kick out of.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/04/19/movies_ive_written_about/'><h1>Movies I&#39;ve written about...</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I borrowed some movies from Richy this past weekend (namely Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Batman, and Batman Returns). It reminded me just how good Jurassic Park was. Heck, I even used a quote from it in my high school yearbook (you ever look back at that sort of stuff and wonder what you were thinking&hellip; all sorts of really meaningful/significant quotes you can put in there, and I put in something from a fairly silly hollywood flick).</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/04/18/css/'><h1>CSS</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I realized that IE and Mozilla parse CSS stuff differently. Apparently, Mozilla will interpret everything on a line after # as a comment (at least where appropriate) whereas IE seems to interpret it normally. As a result, my movie db looked absolutely awful in IE since I almost never use it. Anyway, now that I know, I&rsquo;ve taken care of it. Should looke the same in IE and Mozilla now (at least it does for me in IE6).</p>
