                <p>Finally got around to integrating my movies page with the rest of the site. It&rsquo;s definitely hacky at this point (made a custom wordpress page style containing most of the php code and simply created an empty page that uses that style), but at least it works. Still need to refine it some. I stripped out most of the db fields from getting displayed since I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t have as much screen width to work with, but I should fine tune what I display.</p>

                <p>Just decided to go poking around the web to see if there was any news about a DVD release of Kenneth Branaugh&rsquo;s Hamlet. Turns out there is! Warner Home Video is slated to release a 10th anniversary special edition DVD in 2006! Kick-ass!</p>

                <p>I hate stupid people. Amanda and I were enjoying a nice dinner at Nitaya Thai last night when this flock of heathens came in. I knew they were heathens because they promptly asked for a kids&rsquo; menu. Where do they think they were&hellip; Denny&rsquo;s? Gets worse from there. When they find out there&rsquo;s no kids&rsquo; menu, they&rsquo;re youngest broodling has the nerve to confront the waitress with a loud, finger-quoted &ldquo;what do you mean no kids&rsquo; menu?</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m a little late in posting this (ISCA &lsquo;05 in Madison and all that rot), but in Steve Jobs&rsquo; keynote at Apple&rsquo;s WWDC he dropped a bombshell&hellip; Apple&rsquo;s dropping the PowerPC and switching to Intel/x86. Engadget has some analysis on the decision, but I guess it largely boils down to limitations they&rsquo;ve experienced with the PowerPC platform. To recap, Motorola had been making all the PowerPC chips for Apple until their G5 schedule didn&rsquo;t meet Apple&rsquo;s needs.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2005/05/30/domain-name-greed/'><h1>Domain Name Greed</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So I did a little more research into the gottlieb.* domain names. I had considered something along those lines before ending up with malkier.com since all the appropriate gottlieb stuff was taken. Most are held by legitimate parties (ie people/businesses with the name gottlieb), but gottlieb.net is actually being squatted on by a rather shifting looking domain service, buydomains.com. Turns out these scumbags run around buying up domains with the hopes that someone would buy them for a pretty penny.</p>

                <p>I got some more of the disposable cameras from the wedding processed. Nothing too interesting aside from a few shots of the cats I took to use up film that I&rsquo;ve put up in the usual place. Here are a couple of highlights:
Merry likes to play in the laundry
Spooky likes to play in the big soup pot Silly kitties! And now that my folks have come to visit the grand-kitties (don&rsquo;t ask&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t coin the phrase), they have all sorts of new cat toys to play with.</p>

                <p>Been rather busy lately. Went to my cousin&rsquo;s wedding 3 weekends ago in Missouri/Kansas. Then flew down to Amanda&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s wedding in Texas 2 weekends ago. My folks have been visiting this past week and just left on Sunday morning. To top that off, I&rsquo;ve had some sort of nasty sinus infection for the past week. Next weekend we&rsquo;re off to Iowa for Amanda&rsquo;s coworker&rsquo;s wedding and on the way back I&rsquo;ll be going to ISCA &lsquo;05 in Wisconsin for a few days.</p>

                <p>The big E3 entertainment expo featured the first real info on the next generation game consoles. Xbox360 features a PowerPC with 3 cores, graphics by ATI, some backwards compatibility. PS3 features a beastly PowerPC-based Cell processor (ie roughly twice the flops of the Xbox360), graphics by Nvidia, Blu-Ray support, and full backwards compatibility (PS1 and PS2). Very limited details on the Nintendo Revolution: backwards compatible with Gamecube games, support for downloading old school Nintendo games (NES, SNES, N64&hellip; not sure how the pricing scheme will work for this).</p>
