                <p>Rachel and her roommate Tammy (who&rsquo;s a hoot btw) came down Friday night to catch the show at the Canopy Club featuring The Living Blue, Tractor Kings, Dark Country, and The Dolphin. We showed up some time during the Dolphin&rsquo;s set and all I have to say is weird. I couldn&rsquo;t really tell whether they were playing something or just getting setup and making random noises on-stage. We elected to wait out at the bar until after their set was over.</p>

                <p>Looks like their calendar solution has gone &ldquo;live&rdquo;. Looks like it has most of the stuff I&rsquo;d like&hellip; add events via web, multiple calendars, publish all info or free/busy info (or nothing), subscribing to other published calendars (such as the UIUC Academic calendar courtesy of ACM&rsquo;s Macwarriors), import CSV/iCal, export XML/iCal, assorted notification options, some sort of ability to auto-add event invites, manage who you share a given calendar with (including giving them the ability to manage events).</p>

                <p>So Google seems to be releasing all sorts of cool tech these days. You&rsquo;ve got Gmail, which I&rsquo;ve been pretty pleased with (all my email accounts forward there now). There&rsquo;s Google Bookmarks that I think are tied into their &ldquo;personalized home&rdquo; stuff. I know you can view/add them via the Google toolbar in IE, but last I knew there wasn&rsquo;t an equivalent for browsers that don&rsquo;t suck (eg Firefox). It&rsquo;s kinda nice to have a web-based place for me to store bookmarks (so I can access them at home/work/etc), but I wish there was a better way to add links independent of the IE toolbar (eg a button to add a bookmark vs.</p>

                <p>Lee and I trekked up to Chicago to catch The New Pornographers / Belle &amp; Sebastian play at the Riviera Friday night.
I handled travel plans (directions to the Park&amp;Ride; station where we parked and caught the &ldquo;L&rdquo;, trains to take, transfers to make, how to get to the theater, last train we&rsquo;d have to catch).Â Pretty uneventful trip for the most part.Â The most interesting part was how the bike lane to the side of the road in Chicago was used as a thug passing lane by many.</p>

                <p>manscaping: to groom a man. Shaving, waxing, cleaning up the superfluous fur.
Courtest of the Urban Dictionary.Â A collaborative (think wikipedia) dictionary for modern slang.Â Found out about this earlier this week on the Rep yahoo group.Â Since a lot of slang is a bit crude in nature, I don&rsquo;t have to warn you that this site may offend some of the prudish folk out there.Â You&rsquo;ve been warned&hellip;Â I could probably spend all day looking through that site.</p>
