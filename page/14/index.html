                <p>A while back Lee clued me into eMusic, a cool indie music mp3 site (subscription based, but their high-quality, mp3s unencumberd by any crappy drm). Managed to stumble over Angie Heaton who has a few albums out. Was listening to her when Amanda asked me who that was&hellip; when I told her, she said Rachel had listened to her. I took that as a cue to ask Rachel what she listened to next time I saw her.</p>

                <p>Amanda&rsquo;s Cingular contract finally ran out on Monday, so we ran out and switched to Verizon last night. I&rsquo;d always been pretty happy with my Cingular service, but I was using their old CDMA network (that they stopped selling new phones for over 2 years ago) and a carefully selected phone. And my phone was getting pretty long in the tooth&hellip; I was largely content with the feature set but the battery could get 3 days or so on standby (pretty darned good for a 3+ year old phone I&rsquo;d say).</p>

                <p>Was just down to the basement in CSL to buy a soda only to find they&rsquo;ve jacked the 20oz price up to $1.25. Lame. They don&rsquo;t provide us with free espresso-based beverages, they don&rsquo;t provide us with a convenient places to buy espresso-based beverages, and now they&rsquo;re mugging us on the sodas. How are grad students supposed to work into the wee hours without a cheap source of caffeine? :( Might have to just start bringing my own.</p>

                <p>I hate stupid people. I can accept that the population at large is generally clueless about all things tech, and so I have a fairly high tolerance level when they do annoying newb things. The people that really tick me off are the ones who are clearly in a technical field (say, a whole bunch of people in academia on a FPGA research/education mailing list), and are clearly clueless about very basic concepts such as email&hellip;</p>

                <p>Well, I&rsquo;ve uploaded bits and pieces of the Chicago photos (still not quite done sifting through the stuff from the Field Museum or any of my skyline/downtown shots or those in Millenium Park). You can check them out here.</p>

                <p>Amanda and I just got back last night from a long weekend trip up to Chicago. Headed up there Friday morning and hit the Shedd Aquarium, apparently oldest aquarium in the country (founded 75 years ago). Since we were planning on hitting lots of museums, we picked up &ldquo;city passes&rdquo; that include admission to a number of different sites in the area (if you see more than two of the six, I think you made out well).</p>

                <p>This is a test post from , a fancy photo sharing thing.
Pretty cool. Looks like flickr will let you upload 20M of photos per month, and makes the last 200 you&rsquo;ve posted visible. Has assorted useful features such as tagging photos, controlling who can see photos, etc. Seems pretty cool. I might just use it some for more temporary stuff (ie stuff I don&rsquo;t want to archive on the web forever and take up precious space on my webhost).</p>

                <p>Ran across this site recently. Seems pretty cool. They&rsquo;ve posted a copy of a declassified WWII US submarine manual (well, immediately following the war to be more exact), including scans of all the neat pictures/diagrams/etc and ocr&rsquo;d text.</p>

                <p>Finally got around to integrating my movies page with the rest of the site. It&rsquo;s definitely hacky at this point (made a custom wordpress page style containing most of the php code and simply created an empty page that uses that style), but at least it works. Still need to refine it some. I stripped out most of the db fields from getting displayed since I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t have as much screen width to work with, but I should fine tune what I display.</p>
