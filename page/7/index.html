                <p>Kait (aka student dr. blaze) pinged me for an internet meme she filled out. Since I&rsquo;m not sure I know many people with blogs, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to tap Richy and see if he&rsquo;ll fill it out and pass it on.
 WERE YOU NAMED AFTER ANYONE? No WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CRIED? Saturday DO YOU LIKE YOUR HANDWRITING? Yes, but I wish I could find a pen I like that&rsquo;d allow me to write even smaller while maintaining legibility WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LUNCH MEAT?</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to describe Joost aside from on-demand, internet tv clips from the crew that put together Skype and Kazaa. A while back I managed to land an invite from Joost for their private beta test, and have enjoyed running it on my Macbook Pro (they support Windows and Intel Macs at this point). Very little lag when you first fire up a program, and haven&rsquo;t had any issues once a show starts.</p>

                <p>So the Simpsons are headed for movie theaters everywhere toward the end of the month. Supposedly it&rsquo;s good, but I think I&rsquo;ll wait for the rental. What prompts me to write this post however is one of the features available on the movie website&hellip; create your own Simpsons avatar! Reasonably well done Flash affair where you select body type, hairstyle, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There&rsquo;s of course only a limited number of each of these, but you can achieve a fairly reasonable likeness and save it out as a jpeg.</p>

                <p>Three years ago yesterday, Amanda and I were married in the walled garden in Allerton Park. To celebrate, I made dinner and dessert (many thanks to Giada De Laurentiis of Food Network&rsquo;s Everyday Italian for the tastyness):
  Fiery Angel Hair Pasta (added some chicken cooked in some of the chili oil)
  Raspberry Cream Cupcakes (decided to do a combo of raspberries and strawberries)

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2007/05/24/define-zugunruhe/'><h1>#define zugunruhe</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>In ethology, zugunruhe is anxious behavior in migratory animals that are prevented from migrating, especially in birds. When these animals are enclosed, they exhibit this behaviour during the seasons in which they normally migrate. Behaviourists have been able to study the endocrine controls and navigational mechanisms associated with migration from studying zugunruhe.
This term is German in origin and is a compound of Zug (move, migration) and Unruhe (anxiety, restlessness).</p>

                <p>Those of you who know me should know why I haven&rsquo;t updated in a long time. Amanda and I had a very long month when we went down to Huntsville for Mike&rsquo;s wedding. We had our baby Isaac prematurely, and after fighting for three long weeks in the Huntsville NICU, he passed away peacefully in our arms. We&rsquo;re still having a hard time with it, but I suppose it&rsquo;s good to talk about it.</p>

                <p>Took some pictures of the snow yesterday and put them up on flickr:

We definitely got a fair bit of snow, and some of the drifts were pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the winds and the city plows concentrated and packed the snow on our side of the street (but it did mean our street was plowed a few times as opposed to the more minor streets that maybe saw one pass&hellip; benefits of being a city and school bus route).</p>

                <p>Apparently the UofI hasn&rsquo;t called a snow day since &lsquo;79. That&rsquo;s close to 30 years of no snow days. They had some silly spokesperson on the news last night that tried to claim we were such a hardy campus and liked to walk everywhere so it took an awful lot to shut us down. Apparently they decided that severe blizzard conditions with 45mph gusts and snow falling way faster than the plows could ever hope to keep up with might actually warrant a snow day.</p>

                <p>All classes have been canceled for Tuesday (Feb. 13) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. More than 5 inches of snow fell overnight, up to another foot of snow is possible by Tuesday night and a blizzard warning is in effect. U. of I. employees who have been designated as essential personnel are expected to report to work.
This mailing approved by: The Office of the Chancellor
 The U of I never cancels class.</p>
