                <p>All classes have been canceled for Tuesday (Feb. 13) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. More than 5 inches of snow fell overnight, up to another foot of snow is possible by Tuesday night and a blizzard warning is in effect. U. of I. employees who have been designated as essential personnel are expected to report to work.

The U of I never cancels class.</p>

                <p>All Wednesday (Feb. 14) classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have been cancelled.
Continuing high winds and snow have made it impossible to keep streets and sidewalks clear and safe.
Only personnel providing critical services should continue to report for each work shift until further notice. Employees uncertain about their status should direct any questions to their supervisors.
Classes at the U. of I. Child Development Lab also are cancelled for Wednesday.</p>

                <p>They give me a little taste, and then take it away. I can&rsquo;t take this kind of abuse. I just need my tasty kibbles. Aaah! Can&rsquo;t they hear me begging for one more hit?
Tried to work out some of my energy leaping at the fun string that makes the light come on. Can you believe they left the lid to the washer open? They&rsquo;re out to get me. I just can&rsquo;t stand the pressure.</p>

                <p>Day 752 of my captivity. Found what I hope is one of my captor&rsquo;s favorite possessions. It appears to be some sort of container for transporting instruments of my exploitation and I believe it to be associated with their obnoxious light flashing device.
I have thoroughly inspected it&rsquo;s contents to ascertain if it might hold anything I could use in my escape. Having found nothing, I destroyed it&rsquo;s lining with my claws and ate the outer edges to prevent its further use.</p>

                <p>Day 746 of my captivity. My captors continued to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal.
The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from clawing the furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant.
Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting to hear this for a while, but it&rsquo;s still a bummer to find out that The Reputation have officially broken up. In Elizabeth&rsquo;s words:
As I&rsquo;m guessing many of you have already figured out, the band is over.
Sean quit. Rest of us just gave up, I guess. I don&rsquo;t currently have plans to do any more music or play any more shows. Breaks my fucking heart.</p>

                <p>Have some pics up from my trip to the bay area up at Flickr:
Was a good trip overall. Real good to see Richy and Carrie and get to hang out with them some and see some sights. Got up to the Golden Gate bridge, although didn&rsquo;t see that much since it was really foggy. Headed down to the Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf and wandered around there for a while checking out the sea lions and Ghirardelli and such.</p>

                <p>So life has been pretty&hellip; something recently. Too much going on and not quite enough sanity to go around. Fortunately, I get to head out to San Jose this Sunday to visit with Rich and Carrie&hellip; oh yeah and go to ASPLOS (Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems). Looks like it should be an interesting conference and the best part is I don&rsquo;t have to foot the bill. :)</p>
