                <p>I can&rsquo;t wait! Season 3 of Alias will be released on DVD tomorrow. Think I&rsquo;ll break down and pick up the first two seasons while I&rsquo;m at it (only borrowed them from Richy previously). Probably need to go back and re-watch a bit of Season 2 to remember where things left off. Unfortunately, Season 4 won&rsquo;t start until January. :(</p>

                <p>Spyware and Adware are really icky. At the moment, I&rsquo;m using a three-pronged approach:
 Ad-Aware is designed to provide advanced protection from known Data-mining, aggressive advertising, Parasites, Scumware, selected traditional Trojans, Dialers, Malware, Browser hijackers, and tracking components. You fire it up and it scans your hard disk for nasty crap that has invited itself in. Been using this for a long time. Spybot Search &amp; Destroy is pretty similar, but can catch some stuff that Ad-Aware misses (as Ad-Aware will catch some stuff that Spybot misses).</p>

                <p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to upgrade my blog software from b2 to what it evolved into, WordPress. For the moment, the old setup will continue to reside here, while the new version will reside here. This will be the last post to the old setup, to point people over to the new one. I figured while I was at it, I would revamp the style once again, since I was never 100% happy with the old one.</p>

                <p>I haven&rsquo;t had much luck getting the GNOME GTray app to work under Fedora. Dug around a little bit, and came up with a Firefox extension that largely does the trick (although you should probably just go to the front page and look for the newest version). Now I have to check my browser window to see if I&rsquo;ve got new Gmail as opposed to simply looking at the GNOME system tray, but at least it works.</p>

                <p>Been poking around looking for useful/interesting add-ons for Gmail. Here&rsquo;s a few I&rsquo;ve come up with:
 Gmail notifier - Windows tray app that checks for new mail, sets Gmail as the default mailto handler, official Google add-on GNOME GTray - notifier for Linux GML (GMail loader) - import mail from your old mail client (supports a wide variety) gExodus  graphical import util   FreePOPs - POP3 interface for a variety of webmails, including Gmail GmailFS  turns a Gmail account into a mountable Linux filesystem    </p>

                <p>So. Was driving along last week and heard a big pow from under the hood. Knew that couldn&rsquo;t be good, and it continued to make awful sounds, so I immediately pulled over and called for a tow. Tow was pretty uneventful. Just a quick hop across town via the interstate. Went in to take care of the paperwork while the driver unloaded my car. Came back out to find the car still jacked up and with the hood popped up.</p>

                <p>Watched a little bit of the Speed network recently, and caught a documentary type show on Carroll Shelby. Basically, he&rsquo;s responsible for the monster known as the Cobra (dropping a powerful Ford V-8 into a small/light AC body). Kicked some serious butt in racing for quite a while. After that, he&rsquo;s done several additional iterations/refinements to the basic Cobra idea and worked with Ford on some more performance oriented versions of their Mustang and so forth.</p>
