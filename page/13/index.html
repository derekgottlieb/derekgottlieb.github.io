                <p>What a relief! Just got news the RAID card has come in, was installed, and with a fair bit of manual tinkering the admins managed to restore access to our unbacked-up mount. They&rsquo;re in the process of migrating the data elsewhere and we should have a temporary workaround up and running in short order. Looks like we haven&rsquo;t lost anything since some files have access times from last Friday. Will have to do some testing to see if anything was corrupted, but I&rsquo;m feeling a whole lot better about it than I was earlier today.</p>

                <p>How lame! I&rsquo;ve talked about this game a little previously, and it&rsquo;s looking pretty oustanding. They&rsquo;ve gone back to more of a realistic look from the cel-shaded cartoony stuff of Wind Waker. Not that Wind Waker wasn&rsquo;t cool. But it sounds like it&rsquo;s getting pushed back from November to some time after next March or so (according to IGN). Man, this was announced back in August. Where was I? I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this game too.</p>

                <p>Nintendo&rsquo;s finally announced the controller for their next-gen console (the Revolution). Does anyone besides me find it bizarre?
Sounds like it&rsquo;s somewhere between a one-handed tv remote and an old power glove? There are apparently a couple of sensors placed near the tv plus a sensor in the remote that detect position and orientation. They plan on supporting other &ldquo;more traditional&rdquo; controller types (conventional controller shells, dance mats, bongos, etc) by slipping the remote inside these other add-ons.</p>

                <p>Finally got the site back up. Turns out there was some sort of security breach this past weekend that slipped evil javascript into all of my php/html pages on the site. Looked like it was intended to be some sort of browser buffer overflow attack or something along those lines (the support folk at ipowerweb said it would download a virus?). Anyway, things should be cleared up and safe again for now.</p>

                <p>So I broke down and bought a new mp3 player to take with me when I go jogging&hellip; well jogging/walking&hellip; well really more walking than jogging, but I&rsquo;m still building up toward that. Anyway, looks like it should be a pretty cute little unit. Key features:
It&rsquo;s about a 1&quot; cube has a little OLED display comes in 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB versions (I got the 512) has an FM radio (can even record it at up to 160kbps) 8-10 hours of battery life when playing mp3s USB2.</p>

                <p>Holy crap! There&rsquo;s an Aeon Flux movie in the works! Live action no less! Used to watch this way back in the day on MTV&rsquo;s Liquid Television in the middle of the night&hellip; Wild, bizarre, risque stuff.
Be sure to go check out the trailer. I really don&rsquo;t remember the show having quite that much plot. :)</p>

                <p>There&rsquo;s been some rumors making their way through the geek community that Google has been working on its own IM service (ala ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, etc). Turns out it&rsquo;s live! Mike was ever so kind as to hook me up with an invite, and it seems fairly slick so far. Appears that anyone with a Gmail account can use it.
They&rsquo;ve only got a Windows client that integrates with your Gmail account and even supports voice chats, but their server&rsquo;s running Jabber (opensource IM server).</p>

                <p>I know this was posted last week on slashdot, but it looks like the website for OpenSUSE finally went live. Pretty exciting stuff. First RedHat split their distro into a commercial, &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; class distro and the bleeding-edge, completely open distro Fedora (open in the sense that more than just RedHat employees were actively contributing to its development and direction). Now Novell has opened up SUSE. If I remember correctly, it used to be an exclusively commercial distro if I remember correctly&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t available for free download.</p>
