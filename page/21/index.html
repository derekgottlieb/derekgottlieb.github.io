                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/12/20/disgruntled-clown/'><h1>Disgruntled Clown</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So last weekend (not yesterday but a week before that) Amanda and I went to Bloomington to meet up with a couple of her friends from work to go see a comedy show. It was held in a dive bar (didn&rsquo;t seem all that bad by campus bar standards, but it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a ritzy comedy club either), and featured the Disgruntled Clown. He&rsquo;s the &ldquo;ex-ex-stepfather&rdquo; of one of Amanda&rsquo;s friends (we&rsquo;re not quite sure what&rsquo;s meant by the ex-ex- part&hellip; not the last ex-stepfather, but the one before that?</p>

                <p>So it seems LBB (that&rsquo;s Little Boy Blazejack) has finally come into his own. If you don&rsquo;t know him, he&rsquo;s the &ldquo;little&rdquo; brother of someone I went to high school with. Those of us who knew him always wondered if he would eventually find himself gainfully employed and at the same time doing something he enjoyed. Last I knew, I think he was getting ready to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a major in photojournalism.</p>

                <p>Well, I finally broke down and bought myself a photo printer.
I&rsquo;d been surviving until recently with a close to 10 year old, increasingly finicky laser printer. It&rsquo;s served me well, but I&rsquo;ve had paper feed issues with it for quite some time (ie years) and have been somewhat limited by its inability to make pretty color prints and its dismal speed (did I mention it was an old parallel port model).</p>

                <p>So Lego&rsquo;s working on a video game set in the Lego Star Wars universe (ie Star Wars setting, but stuff is built out of Legos). They have some coverage over at Gamespot, including screenshots. Looks like it should be a pretty cute game, and the initial hands-on demo is impressive.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/12/01/long-overdue/'><h1>Long overdue</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>So this update is long overdue. I&rsquo;ve been really busy recently with&hellip; well, life. First there was the big annual ISCA crunch where I helped Jim get his submission from 0 to paper in less than a week. Part of that was help getting him up and running on NCSA&rsquo;s Itanium-2 cluster (Teragrid) so that he could have results to write about. The other part was helping him get an actual paper together the day of the deadline since Nick was focused on the other project he wanted to submit for.</p>

                <a href='https://thoughts.derekgottlieb.com/blog/2004/11/10/firefox-10/'><h1>Firefox 1.0!</h1> <h2></h2></a>
                <p>Firefox made it&rsquo;s 1.0 release yesterday. If you haven&rsquo;t tried this attractive alternative to IE, go do so now! It&rsquo;s substantially faster than old Mozilla/Netscape, standards compliant (unlike IE), less likely to allow your machine to be filled with spyware (unlike IE), has all sorts of cool extensions to add additional functionality (even redefine existing functionality)&hellip; oh and it won&rsquo;t give you the plague either (unlike IE)! ;) It&rsquo;s just dripping in plague juice!</p>

                <p>Mmmm. Wood floors. Got solid oak installed downstairs over the past couple of days. Really looks outstanding. I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of pics up at the usual place, but they simply don&rsquo;t do it justice. If you have a chance to come see, do so! :) Got an estimate for putting ceramic tile in the kitchen and bathrooms, and replacing the rest of the carpet (stairs and upstairs hall/bedrooms) with new carpet.</p>

                <p>Making progress again on the house (and remembered to bring my camera again too). A bunch of the double-paned windows that had broken seals were replaced on Tuesday (turns out some of the remaining windows were misordered and the sliding glass door is on backorder). Big improvement on the ones that have been replaced though. Will actually be able to look out the windows now. Got the light green paint up on two of the walls in the dining room (but not the overhang near the cathedral ceiling), gold along the north wall with the big picture window in the living room and the sliding glass door in the dining room that leads to the deck.</p>

                <p>So apparently Dell is now shipping a 20&quot; widescreen LCD ala the Apple Cinema dispay. Looks like it&rsquo;s got pretty sweet specs in addition to being priced several hundred less than Apple&rsquo;s. Now if only Dell would have some outrageous deal on it. :)
1680x1050 resolution 16:10 aspect ratio 16ms refresh (12ms gray-to-gray) 600:1 contrast ratio 300cd/m2 brightness analog (VGA) and digital (DVI) inputs, as well as video inputs for S-video and composite connections Picture-in-Picture and picture-by-picture support four USB2.</p>
